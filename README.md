# Modeling the Distribution of Bering Sea Snow Crab

This is part of a NOAA funded project that will create updated species distribution maps for snow crab in the northern Bering Sea. Portions of this work will comprise a chapter in my PhD dissertation.

### Data
Both fishery-independent, fishery-dependent, and oceanographic data will be used for this project, along with ROMS output from the Bering10K. Specifically, we are using:
- The **Alaska Department of Fish and Game Crab Observer Program** data, which are __confidential__. These data include records of catches of snow crab in the targeted fishery as well as bycatch in other crab fisheries. The fisheries for crab typically occur from January to March.
- The NOAA AFSC **Eastern Bering Sea Bottom Trawl Survey** data, which includes catches of snow crab at stations sampled by this survey. Data are available beginning in 1975 and surveys run during the summer months.
- The NOAA AFSC **North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program** data, which are __confidential__. These data include records of snow crab bycatch in the Bering Sea groundfish fisheries (fixed gear and trawl). Data are collected throughout the year.
- The **Bering10K ROMS** output. The output we plan to use include bottom temperature and salinity values. The latest simulations using the CMIP6 will be used.

### Methods
#### Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
#### Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs)
#### Random Forest (RF)
