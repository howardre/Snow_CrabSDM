**Environmental Data**
- Includes depth and gear temperature measurements
- Issues mostly surrounding missing values (777 total) for both
	- Assume this has to do with malfunctioning or lack of equipment
	- More of a problem in early years, but certain years have big gaps (1976, 1977, 1990, 1994)
	- Rare to be missing values beginning in 2006
- Potential solutions
	- Interpolate for years with only a few missing vlaues
		- This won't work during years with big chunks missing because they tend to be clustered in certain regions
	- Just skip samples for which there isn't a close temperature value
		- Lose quite a bit of data doing this
	- Disregard these values, use the Bering10K
		- Need to parameterize if going to be doing forecasting
