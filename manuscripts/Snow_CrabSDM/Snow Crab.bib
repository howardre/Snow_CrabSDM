  abstract = {Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) and rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus) are both commercially valuable, long-lived pleuronectids that are distributed widely throughout the North Pacific. While their ecology and life cycle have been described for southern stocks, few investigations have focused on these species at higher latitudes. We synthesized historical research survey data among critical developmental stages to determine the distribution of life cycle stages for both species in the northern Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Bottom trawl survey data from 1953 to 2004 (25519 trawls) were used to characterize adult distribution during the non-spawning and spawning seasons, ichthyoplankton data from 1972 to 2003 (10776 tows) were used to determine the spatial and vertical distribution of eggs and larvae, and small-meshed shrimp trawl survey data from 1972 to 2004 (6536 trawls) were used to characterize areas utilized by immature stages. During the non-spawning season, adult Dover sole and rex sole were widely distributed from the inner shelf to outer slope. While both species concentrated on the continental slope to spawn, Dover sole spawning areas were more geographically specific than rex sole. Although spawned in deep water, eggs of both species were found in surface waters near spawning areas. Dover sole larvae did not appear to have an organized migration from offshore spawning grounds toward coastal nursery areas, and our data indicated facultative settling to their juvenile habitat in winter. Rex sole larvae progressively moved cross-shelf toward shore as they grew from April to September, and larvae presumably settled in coastal nursery areas in the autumn. In contrast with studies in the southern end of their range, we found no evidence in the GOA that Dover or rex sole have pelagic larval stages longer than nine months; however, more sampling for large larvae is needed in winter offshore of the continental shelf as well as sampling for newly settled larvae over the shelf to verify an abbreviated pelagic larval stage for both species at the northern end of their range.},

  abstract = {In the productive central-Oregon coastal upwelling environment, wind-driven upwelling, tides, and topographic effects vary across the shelf, setting the stage for varied biogeochemical responses to physical drivers. Current, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements from three moorings deployed during the upwelling seasons of 2009–2011 off the central-Oregon coast are analyzed over three time bands (interannual, subtidal, tidal) to explore the relationship between mid (70 m) and inner-shelf (15 m) upwelling dynamics and the associated effect on DO. Topographic effects are observed in each time band due to the Heceta and Stonewall Bank complex. Seasonal cumulative hypoxia (DO {$<$} 1.4 mL L−1) calculations identify two regions, a well-ventilated inner shelf and a midshelf vulnerable to hypoxia (98 ± 15 days annually). On tidal timescales, along-shelf diurnal (K1) velocities are intensified over the Bank, 0.08 m s−1 compared with 0.03 m s−1 to the north. Interannual variability in the timing of spring and fall transitions, defined using glider-measured continental slope source water temperature, is observed on the midshelf. Interannual source water DO concentrations vary on the order of 0.1 mL L−1. Each spring and summer, DO decline rates are modulated by physical and biological processes. The net observed decrease is about 30\% of the expected draw down due to water-column respiration. Physical processes initiate low-oxygen conditions on the shelf through coastal upwelling and subsequently prevent the system via advection and mixing from reaching the potential anoxic levels anticipated from respiration rates alone.},

  abstract = {Incubation of sablefish eggs was investigated as part of a larger collaborative project on sablefish culture. Gametes of ripe adults, trap-caught, were transported separately to the laboratory in a cold chest at 3–4°C. Fertilizability of the eggs declined to 50\% following 36 min immersion in 35‰ salinity sea water; under identical conditions sperm fertilization potential declined to 50\% 1 min after addition of milt to sea water. From these data a fertilization procedure was developed that provided 85–90\% egg fertilization. Under short-term “dry” storage (3–6°C), sperm motility remained high for 300–500 h; data on egg storage was not obtained. Fertilized, water-hardened eggs were 2.07–2.11 mm in diameter. From fertilization to hatching incubation times were obtained from 2.2 to 6.6°C; times to a number of embryonic stages were obtained from 3.6 to 7.9°C. The eggs are extremely fragile and easily damaged in culture. Percentage survival to hatching (20–35‰ salinity, 2.1–8°C) was 0–12.9\%. Maximum survival to hatching occurred at salinities of 34–35‰ and temperatures of 4–6.6°C. Total length of larvae of few hours to several days after maximum hatch was 4.7–5.3 mm. Neutral buoyancy of developing eggs and larvae varied in a complex manner. From these data and related observations a model is presented indicating where developing eggs and larvae are likely to be found in the natural water column, a model that also could lead to the provision of oxygen requirements during the planktonic drift stages of egg and early larval development.},

Estimates are given of direction, depth, and duration of drift of the pelagic stages until exhaustion of the yolk. Environmental variability in the spawning period is related to existing measures of year-class strength.

The paper describes the methodology for reading the larval and juvenile otoliths, for reconstructing the correspondence in space and time between juveniles and larvae using Lagrangian simulations, and for comparing the otolith growth rates among the reconstructed sub-cohorts. Virtual buoys were released weekly on the grid of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and their trajectories were tracked. The origin of an individual was determined by selecting the trajectory beginning on its hatching week and ending at the minimum distance of its sampling location on the sampling date. Larvae and juveniles with the same spatio-temporal origin were selected and supposed to belong to the same sub-cohorts. The surviving juveniles showed faster growth rates during their larval period than the pool of larvae they were estimated to originate from, which supports the idea of growth-selective survival. Alternative interpretations (transport and gear selectivity) are discussed. Variations in otolith growth pattern also suggest a higher juvenile growth over the shelf break than in oceanic waters.},

  abstract = {Species distribution shifts are a widely reported biological consequence of climate-driven warming across marine ecosystems, creating ecological and social challenges. To meet these challenges and inform management decisions, we need accurate projections of species distributions. Quantitative species distribution models (SDMs) are routinely used to make these projections, while qualitative climate change vulnerability assessments are becoming more common. We constructed SDMs, compared SDM projections to expectations from a qualitative expert climate change vulnerability assessment, and developed a novel approach for combining the two methods to project the distribution and relative biomass of 49 marine species in the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem under a “business as usual” climate change scenario. A forecasting experiment using SDMs highlighted their ability to capture relative biomass patterns fairly well (mean Pearson’s correlation coefficient between predicted and observed biomass = 0.24, range = 0–0.6) and pointed to areas needing improvement, including reducing prediction error and better capturing fine-scale spatial variability. SDM projections suggest the region will undergo considerable biological changes, especially in the Gulf of Maine, where commercially-important groundfish and traditional forage species are expected to decline as coastal fish species and warmer-water forage species historically found in the southern New England/Mid-Atlantic Bight area increase. The SDM projections only occasionally aligned with vulnerability assessment expectations, with agreement more common for species with adult mobility and population growth rates that showed low sensitivity to climate change. Although our blended approach tried to build from the strengths of each method, it had no noticeable improvement in predictive ability over SDMs. This work rigorously evaluates the predictive ability of SDMs, quantifies expected species distribution shifts under future climate conditions, and tests a new approach for integrating SDMs and vulnerability assessments to help address the complex challenges arising from climate-driven species distribution shifts.},

Unlike the original Blob, Blob 2.0 peaked in the summer, a season when little is known about the physical drivers of such events. We show that Blob 2.0 primarily results from a prolonged weakening of the North Pacific High-Pressure System. This reduces surface winds and decreases evaporative cooling and wind-driven upper ocean mixing. Warmer ocean conditions then reduce low-cloud fraction, reinforcing the marine heatwave through a positive low-cloud feedback. Using an atmospheric model forced with observed SSTs, we also find that remote SST forcing from the central equatorial and, surprisingly, the subtropical North Pacific Ocean contribute to the weakened North Pacific High. Our multi-faceted analysis sheds light on the physical drivers governing the intensity and longevity of summertime North Pacific marine heatwaves.},

  abstract = {Estuaries have long been recognized as nursery habitats for various marine fish species. As seascapes consisting of a mosaic of habitat patches, estuarine nurseries incorporate ecological processes such as ontogenetic shifts. To improve our understanding of the habitat requirement changes of nursery species within the estuarine seascape, habitat suitability models were built using boosted regression trees for three size classes of European flounder (Platichthys flesus) juveniles. The models combined several dynamic and static predictors, from physical and chemical water parameters to biological and physical habitat variables. The relationships between juveniles and predictor variables varied with size, potentially indicating the dynamics of habitat use for the juvenile flounder inside the estuarine nursery. Younger post-settled juveniles tended to be spatially constrained to a shallow upstream area and, with size, there were ontogenetic shifts to the middle estuary. This demonstrates the importance of considering different life stages when developing essential fish habitat maps, which reflect fine scale temporal and spatial distributions. Given the high level of anthropogenic pressures to which estuaries are subjected, the consideration of fish ontogenetic habitat requirements within the estuarine nursery is needed to identify high-value areas, and is valuable for developing effective spatial and temporal management plans. These are essential to fully protect the most sensitive life stages, such as early post-settlement stages occupying transient habitats. Additionally, and as the juvenile-habitat associations can rapidly change, fine-scale connectivity in the estuarine nursery becomes even more relevant in determining recruitment. Connectivity should therefore be central in conservation planning, in order to sustain estuarine and marine adult populations, and ultimately maintaining the fisheries.},

The extent of bottom trawling footprint (seabed area trawled at least once in a specified region and time period) is often contested but poorly described. We quantify footprints using high-resolution satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS) and logbook data on 24 continental shelves and slopes to 1,000-m depth over at least 2 years. Trawling footprint varied markedly among regions: from {$<$}10\% of seabed area in Australian and New Zealand waters, the Aleutian Islands, East Bering Sea, South Chile, and Gulf of Alaska to {$>$}50\% in some European seas. Overall, 14\% of the 7.8 million-km2 study area was trawled, and 86\% was not trawled. Trawling activity was aggregated; the most intensively trawled areas accounting for 90\% of activity comprised 77\% of footprint on average. Regional swept area ratio (SAR; ratio of total swept area trawled annually to total area of region, a metric of trawling intensity) and footprint area were related, providing an approach to estimate regional trawling footprints when high-resolution spatial data are unavailable. If SAR was ≤0.1, as in 8 of 24 regions, there was {$>$}95\% probability that {$>$}90\% of seabed was not trawled. If SAR was 7.9, equal to the highest SAR recorded, there was {$>$}95\% probability that {$>$}70\% of seabed was trawled. Footprints were smaller and SAR was ≤0.25 in regions where fishing rates consistently met international sustainability benchmarks for fish stocks, implying collateral environmental benefits from sustainable fishing.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of broad-scale global patterns in beta diversity (i.e., variation or turnover in identities of species) for marine systems is in its infancy. We analysed the beta diversity of groundfish communities along the North American Pacific coast, from trawl data spanning 32.57°N to 48.52°N and 51 m to 1200 m depth. Analyses were based on both the Jaccard measure and the probabilistic Raup-Crick measure, which accounts for variation in alpha diversity. Overall, beta diversity decreased with depth, and this effect was strongest at lower latitudes. Superimposed on this trend were peaks in beta diversity at around 400–600 m and also around 1000–1200 m, which may indicate high turnover around the edges of the oxygen minimum zone. Beta diversity was also observed to decrease with latitude, but this effect was only observed in shallower waters ({$<$}200 m); latitudinal turnover began to disappear at depths {$>$}800 m. At shallower depths ({$<$}200 m), peaks in latitudinal turnover were observed at ∼43°N, 39°N, 35°N and 31°N, which corresponded well with several classically observed oceanographic boundaries. Turnover with depth was stronger than latitudinal turnover, and is likely to reflect strong environmental filtering over relatively short distances. Patterns in beta diversity, including latitude-by-depth interactions, should be integrated with other biodiversity measures in ecosystem-based management and conservation of groundfish communities.},

Yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), canary rockfish (S. pinniger) and bocaccio (S. paucispinis) in the inland waterways of Puget Sound (PS), WA, USA were listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2010. These listings relied heavily on evidence from other species that these populations were ‘discrete’ taxonomic units because little information was available for these species in PS. To fill this data gap, we collaborated with recreational fishing communities in PS to collect tissue samples and used population genetics analyses to determine whether samples from PS were genetically differentiated from samples collected from the outer coasts of the U.S. and Canada. Multiple analyses using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data showed that yelloweye rockfish in PS and British Columbia, Canada were genetically different from coastal populations, while canary rockfish showed no genetic differentiation. These results support hypotheses that the genetic connectivity of rockfish populations is based on interactions between life-history characteristics and oceanographic conditions. These data also support the ESA designation status and the expansion of protected geographical boundaries for yelloweye rockfish but also suggest canary rockfish in PS are not a ‘discrete’ population and may not meet the first criterion of the ESA, as initially assumed. Collaboration among agencies and fishing communities, and cost-efficient genetic analyses provided a framework for collecting and analyzing data essential to the conservation and management of threatened and endangered species.},

  abstract = {Using observed data sets mainly for the period 1979–2005, we find that anomalous warming events different from conventional El Niño events occur in the central equatorial Pacific. This unique warming in the central equatorial Pacific associated with a horseshoe pattern is flanked by a colder sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) on both sides along the equator. empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of monthly tropical Pacific SSTA shows that these events are represented by the second mode that explains 12\% of the variance. Since a majority of such events are not part of El Niño evolution, the phenomenon is named as El Niño Modoki (pseudo-El Niño) (“Modoki” is a classical Japanese word, which means “a similar but different thing”). The El Niño Modoki involves ocean-atmosphere coupled processes which include a unique tripolar sea level pressure pattern during the evolution, analogous to the Southern Oscillation in the case of El Niño. Hence the total entity is named as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Modoki. The ENSO Modoki events significantly influence the temperature and precipitation over many parts of the globe. Depending on the season, the impacts over regions such as the Far East including Japan, New Zealand, western coast of United States, etc., are opposite to those of the conventional ENSO. The difference maps between the two periods of 1979–2004 and 1958–1978 for various oceanic/atmospheric variables suggest that the recent weakening of equatorial easterlies related to weakened zonal sea surface temperature gradient led to more flattening of the thermocline. This appears to be a cause of more frequent and persistent occurrence of the ENSO Modoki event during recent decades.},

  abstract = {The Arctic icescape is rapidly transforming from a thicker multiyear ice cover to a thinner and largely seasonal first-year ice cover with significant consequences for Arctic primary production. One critical challenge is to understand how productivity will change within the next decades. Recent studies have reported extensive phytoplankton blooms beneath ponded sea ice during summer, indicating that satellite-based Arctic annual primary production estimates may be significantly underestimated. Here we present a unique time-series of a phytoplankton spring bloom observed beneath snow-covered Arctic pack ice. The bloom, dominated by the haptophyte algae Phaeocystis pouchetii, caused near depletion of the surface nitrate inventory and a decline in dissolved inorganic carbon by 16\,±\,6\,g\,C m−2. Ocean circulation characteristics in the area indicated that the bloom developed in situ despite the snow-covered sea ice. Leads in the dynamic ice cover provided added sunlight necessary to initiate and sustain the bloom. Phytoplankton blooms beneath snow-covered ice might become more common and widespread in the future Arctic Ocean with frequent lead formation due to thinner and more dynamic sea ice despite projected increases in high-Arctic snowfall. This could alter productivity, marine food webs and carbon sequestration in the Arctic Ocean.},

The area occupied by northern cod was positively correlated with stock abundance. That is, when more abundant, the stock occupied a larger area, and the observed stock decline was associated with a shrinkage of occupied range. This relationship was demonstrated using two different techniques: area occupied by 90\% of the estimated biomass and a statistical ellipse technique describing the bivariate central tendency of the catch data. This latter technique is novel and allows straightforward quantification and visualization of distribution data. The declines in occupied area preceded declines in estimated biomass, confirming previous work which indicated a breakdown in population structure beginning in 1989. The analyses also confirm distribution changes both southward and offshore since 1988. We hypothesize that the cod concentrated in the southern range of the stock beginning in 1990, perhaps as a result of environmental factors, and resultant increases in local density led to increased catchability and fishing mortality for offshore fleets such that catch rates remained high as the stock declined.},

  abstract = {Understanding changes in the migratory and reproductive phenology of fish stocks in relation to climate change is critical for accurate ecosystem-based fisheries management. Relocation and changes in timing of reproduction can have dramatic effects upon the success of fish populations and throughout the food web. During anomalously warm conditions (1–4°C above normal) in the northeast Pacific Ocean during 2015–2016, we documented shifts in timing and spawning location of several pelagic fish stocks based on larval fish samples. Total larval concentrations in the northern California Current (NCC) during winter (January–March) 2015 and 2016 were the highest observed since annual collections first occurred in 1998, primarily due to increased abundances of Engraulis mordax (northern anchovy) and Sardinops sagax (Pacific sardine) larvae, which are normally summer spawning species in this region. Sardinops sagax and Merluccius productus (Pacific hake) exhibited an unprecedented early and northward spawning expansion during 2015–16. In addition, spawning duration was greatly increased for E. mordax, as the presence of larvae was observed throughout the majority of 2015–16, indicating prolonged and nearly continuous spawning of adults throughout the warm period. Larvae from all three of these species have never before been collected in the NCC as early in the year. In addition, other southern species were collected in the NCC during this period. This suggests that the spawning phenology and distribution of several ecologically and commercially important fish species dramatically and rapidly changed in response to the warming conditions occurring in 2014–2016, and could be an indication of future conditions under projected climate change. Changes in spawning timing and poleward migration of fish populations due to warmer ocean conditions or global climate change will negatively impact areas that were historically dependent on these fish, and change the food web structure of the areas that the fish move into with unforeseen consequences.},

  abstract = {Walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma (pollock hereafter) is a key ecological and economic species in the eastern Bering Sea, yet detailed synthesis of the spatial and temporal patterns of pollock ichthyoplankton in this important region is lacking. This knowledge gap is particularly severe considering that egg and larval distribution are essential to reconstructing spawning locations and early life stages drift pathways. We used 19 yr of ichthyoplankton collections to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of egg and larval distribution. Generalized additive models (GAMs) identified two primary temporal pulses of pollock eggs, the first occurring from 20 February to 31 March and the second from 20 April to 20 May; larvae showed similar, but slightly lagged, pulses. Based on generalized cross-validation and information theory, a GAM model that allowed for different seasonal patterns in egg density within three unique areas outperformed a GAM that assumed a single fixed seasonal pattern across the entire eastern Bering Sea. This ‘area-dependent’ GAM predicted the highest densities of eggs (i.e., potential spawning locations) in three major areas of the eastern Bering Sea: near Bogoslof Island (February–April), north of Unimak Island and the Alaska Peninsula (March–April), and around the Pribilof Islands (April–August). Unique temporal patterns of egg density were observed for each area, suggesting that pollock spawning may be more spatially and temporally complex than previously assumed. Moreover, this work provides a valuable baseline of pollock spawning to which future changes, such as those resulting from climate variability, may be compared.},

  abstract = {Offshore- and deepwater-spawning flatfish species face the problem of transport of their planktonic stages to shallow juvenile nursery grounds that are often far shoreward in bays or estuaries. We compare life history attributes of four offshore-spawning flatfish species in the Gulf of Alaska: Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), rex sole (Glyptocephalus zachirus) and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) to examine how their larvae get from a spawning location at the edge or beyond the continental shelf to specific inshore nursery zones. We utilize historical records of survey catches of different life stages to characterize the stage-specific changes in distribution of spawning, planktonic stages and juvenile nursery areas. We infer transport mechanisms based on the shifts in distribution of the life stages and in comparison with local physical oceanography. This comparison provides insight into the different mechanisms marine species may use to solve the common ‘problem’ of planktonic drift and juvenile settlement.},

We analyzed a 34-year time series of eastern Bering Sea fish surveys to evaluate changes in distribution by length and between cold and warm shelf-wide average water temperatures for 20 species over inhabited depth, temperature, and location. All species showed evidence of ontogenetic migration. Differences in distribution between years with warm and years with cold shelf-wide water temperatures varied among species and within species at different lengths. For species where shelf-wide temperature effects were detected, the mid-sized fish were most active in changing spatial distribution. For aquatic organisms ontogenetic migration occurs because life history stages have different environmental requirements. This study illustrates the need to consider species responses to climate change over different life history stages, and that studies on ecosystem responses should take ontogenetic differences into consideration when assessing impacts.},

  abstract = {The deposition of phosphorus (P) from African dust is believed to play an important role in bolstering primary productivity in the Amazon Basin and Tropical Atlantic Ocean (TAO), leading to sequestration of carbon dioxide. However, there are few measurements of African dust in South America that can robustly test this hypothesis and even fewer measurements of soluble P, which is readily available for stimulating primary production in the ocean. To test this hypothesis, we measured total and soluble P in long-range transported aerosols collected in Cayenne, French Guiana, a TAO coastal site located at the northeastern edge of the Amazon. Our measurements confirm that in boreal spring when African dust transport is greatest, dust supplies the majority of P, of which 5\% is soluble. In boreal fall, when dust transport is at an annual minimum, we measured unexpectedly high concentrations of soluble P, which we show is associated with the transport of biomass burning (BB) from southern Africa. Integrating our results into a chemical transport model, we show that African BB supplies up to half of the P deposited annually to the Amazon from transported African aerosol. This observational study links P-rich BB aerosols from Africa to enhanced P deposition in the Amazon. Contrary to current thought, we also show that African BB is a more important source of soluble P than dust to the TAO and oceans in the Southern Hemisphere and may be more important for marine productivity, particularly in boreal summer and fall.},

  abstract = {During summer 2001, high-resolution hydrographic, velocity, and bio-optical surveys were conducted over Heceta Bank off central Oregon. North of the bank, upwelling over simple bottom topography exhibited a classic response with a midshelf, baroclinic coastal jet and upwelled isopycnals. The coastal upwelling jet follows the bank topography as it widens offshore before reaching the southern end of the bank, where the shelf break turns almost 90° back toward the coast. The ensuing adjustment involves the offshelf transport of coastal water and the material it contains. The jet meanders anticyclonically in the “lee” of the bank before resuming its equatorward path seaward of the shelf break. A pool of high-chlorophyll ({$>$}15 mg m−3) near-surface water is found in the low-velocity “lee” region created by the bank. A low-temperature, high-salinity bottom water pool, supplied primarily from the south, lies over the inshore region of the bank. This bottom pool is up to 40 m thick and contains elevated levels of suspended material. By creating an east-west perturbation in the coastal upwelling front, the flow-topography interaction introduces an alongshore pressure gradient. When southward upwelling-favorable winds relax, this alongshore pressure gradient can drive flow back to the north. This leads to northward flow on the inshore side of the bank, ultimately setting up the potential for recirculation around the entire bank complex on a timescale of about 10 days. Strong northward winds during summer lead to downwelling within 15 km of the coast, accompanied by significant ({$>$}0.2 m s−1) wind-driven northward currents.},

  abstract = {Near-bottom waters over the continental shelf off Oregon in the northern  California Current have become increasingly hypoxic over the last decade, including the appearance of anoxia in summer 2006. Observed ecosystem impacts include the absence of fish and invertebrate die-offs. Near-bottom, inner-shelf hypoxia is driven by upwelling of low-oxygen, nutrient-rich source water onto the continental shelf, followed by the decay of organic matter from surface phytoplankton blooms. We are using data from moorings, ship surveys, and from over 60,000 kilometers of autonomous underwater glider tracks to understand the temporal and spatial distribution of dissolved oxygen over the continental margin off Oregon. The inshore side of Heceta Bank, a submarine bank that deflects the coastal upwelling jet seaward creating a region of weaker velocities inshore, is particularly vulnerable to hypoxia. Near-bottom dissolved oxygen variability is driven by changes in both the dissolved oxygen concentrations in offshore upwelling source water and local wind forcing. "Source water" is defined as being seaward of the continental shelf break on density surfaces that upwell onto the continental shelf. The strength and depth of the onshore source water flux due to wind-driven upwelling can vary through the upwelling season, influencing near-bottom shelf hypoxia. Late in the upwelling season, upwelled source waters can become lower in oxygen due to off-shelf flux of continental shelf water that has undergone respiration and is, therefore, lower in oxygen than unmodified upwelling source water. For present day source water dissolved oxygen concentrations ( 2.3 ml/l), hypoxia over the inner shelf on the inshore side of Heceta Bank during the summer upwelling season is observed about 50\% of the time. Given the recent declining trend in source water dissolved oxygen concentration, in 50 years the frequency of the hypoxia over the inner shelf on the inshore side of Heceta Bank is predicted to be about 90\%.},

  abstract = {Hake recruitment has been examined in relation to environmental variables in two of the main reproductive areas of the central Mediterranean, the northern and central Tyrrhenian Sea. Seventeen years time series data from trawl surveys revealed high fluctuations in recruit abundance that could not be just explained by spawning biomass estimations. Generalized additive models were developed to investigate hake recruitment dynamics in the Tyrrhenian Sea in relation to spawner abundance and selected key oceanographic variables. Environmental data were explored in attempt to explain survival processes that could affect early life history stages of hake and that accounted for high fluctuations in its recruitment. Thermal anomalies in summer, characterised by high peaks in water temperature, revealed a negative effect on the abundance of recruits in autumn, probably due to a reduction in hake egg and larval survival rates. In the northern Tyrrhenian, recruitment was reduced when elevated sea-surface temperatures were coupled with lower levels of water circulation. Enhanced spring primary production, related to late winter low temperatures could affect water mass productivity in the following months, thus influencing spring recruitment. In the central Tyrrhenian a dome-shaped relationship between wind mixing in early spring and recruitment could be interpreted as an “optimal environmental window” in which intermediate water mixing level played a positive role in phytoplankton displacement, larval feeding rate and appropriate larval drift. Results are discussed in relation to the decline in hake stock biomass and within the present climate change and global warming context.},

Disentangling these two sources of variability has challenged ecologists working in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Using a novel spatially explicit statistical model, we tested for the presence of density-independent and density-dependent habitat selection in yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) in the eastern Bering Sea. We found specificities in the density-dependent processes operating across ontogeny and particularly with gender. Density-dependent habitat expansion occurred primarily in females, and to a lesser degree in males. These patterns were especially evident in adult stages, while juvenile stages of both sexes exhibited a mix of different dynamics. Association of yellowfin sole with substrate type also varied by sex and to a lesser degree with size, with large females distributed over a wider range of substrates than males. Moreover, yellowfin sole expanded northward as cold subsurface waters retracted in summer, suggesting high sensitivity to arctic warming. Our findings illustrate how marginal habitats can play an important role in buffering density-dependent habitat expansion, with direct implications for resource management. Our spatially explicit modeling approach is effective in evaluating density-dependent spatial dynamics, and can easily be used to test similar hypotheses from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Changes in marine plankton communities driven by environmental variability impact the marine food web and global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other elements. To predict and assess these community shifts and their consequences, ecologists are increasingly investigating how the functional traits of plankton determine their relative fitness along environmental and biological gradients. Laboratory, field and modelling studies are adopting this trait-based approach to map the biogeography of plankton traits that underlies variations in plankton communities. Here, we review progress towards understanding the regulatory roles of several key plankton functional traits, including cell size, N2-fixation and mixotrophy among phytoplankton, and body size, ontogeny and feeding behaviour for zooplankton. The trait biogeographical approach sheds light on what structures plankton communities in the current ocean, as well as under climate change scenarios, and also allows for finer resolution of community function because community trait composition determines the rates of significant processes, including carbon export. Although understanding of trait biogeography is growing, uncertainties remain that stem, in part, from the paucity of observations describing plankton functional traits. Thus, in addition to recommending widespread adoption of the trait-based approach, we advocate for enhanced collection, standardisation and dissemination of plankton functional trait data.},

Lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) are a common demersal fish on the west coast of North America and are exploited both commercially and recreationally across the entirety of their range. Due to stock declines, Lingcod are managed using a variety of fisheries management tools, including spatial management. This study represents a unique in situ investigation of demersal habitat utilization by Lingcod at the southern portion of their range (Point Arena to Morro Bay, California). ROV and towed camera sled derived underwater video imagery were coupled with high-resolution bathymetry data and evaluated using Generalized Linear Models to investigate: a) how Lingcod are distributed relative to seafloor habitats along California’s central coast, b) the extent to which any ontogenetic patterns varied across habitats, and c) how associations based on visual observations compare to those from landscape modeling analysis. The results of this study clearly depicted an ontogenetic shift in Lingcod habitat utilization. Lingcod shifted from primarily low relief, soft sediments as young to mixed substrates at intermediate ages and ultimately to primarily harder substrates as adults. These results are important in the context of on-going marine spatial planning wherein further information on the habitat associations of targeted species can allow for more refined management.},

Marine N2O stems from nitrification and denitrification processes which depend on organic matter cycling and dissolved oxygen (O2). We introduce N2O as an obligate intermediate product of denitrification and as an O2-dependent by-product from nitrification in the Bern3D ocean model. A large model ensemble is used to probabilistically constrain modern and to project marine N2O production for a low (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6) and high GHG (RCP8.5) scenario extended to A.D. 10,000. Water column N2O and surface ocean partial pressure N2O data serve as constraints in this Bayesian framework. The constrained median for modern N2O production is 4.5 (±1σ range: 3.0 to 6.1) Tg N yr−1, where 4.5\% stems from denitrification. Modeled denitrification is 65.1 (40.9 to 91.6) Tg N yr−1, well within current estimates. For high GHG forcing, N2O production decreases by 7.7\% over this century due to decreasing organic matter export and remineralization. Thereafter, production increases slowly by 21\% due to widespread deoxygenation and high remineralization. Deoxygenation peaks in two millennia, and the global O2 inventory is reduced by a factor of 2 compared to today. Net denitrification is responsible for 7.8\% of the long-term increase in N2O production. On millennial timescales, marine N2O emissions constitute a small, positive feedback to climate change. Our simulations reveal tight coupling between the marine carbon cycle, O2, N2O, and climate.},

  abstract = {Many of the world’s most vulnerable and rapidly changing ecosystems are also among the most data-poor, leading to an increased interest in use of local ecological knowledge (LEK) to document long-term environmental change. The integration of multiple knowledge sources for assessing species abundance and distribution has gained traction over the past decade as a growing number of case studies show concordance between LEK and scientific data. This study advances the use of quantitative approaches for synthesizing LEK by presenting a novel application of bootstrapping and statistical modeling to evaluate variance in ecological observations of fisheries practitioners. We developed an historical record of abundance for 22 marine species in Puget Sound, Washington (USA), using LEK, and we quantified variation in perceptions of abundance trends among fishers, divers, and researchers. These individuals differed in aspects of their information environments, which are characterized by how, when, and where an individual has acquired ecological information. Abundance trends derived from interviews suggest that populations of long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have been in decline since at least the 1960s and that three rockfishes protected under the Endangered Species Act were perceived as relatively less abundant than other species. Differences in perception of rockfish abundance trends among age groups were consistent with our hypothesis that the reported magnitude of decline in abundance would increase with age, with younger respondents more likely to report high abundance than older individuals across all periods. Temporal patterns in the mean and variance of reported rockfish abundance indices were qualitatively similar between fishers and researchers; however, fishers reported higher indices of abundance than researchers for all but one rockfish species. The two respondent groups reported similar changes in rockfish abundance from the 1940s to 2000s, except for two recreationally valuable species that fishers perceived as having undergone greater declines than perceived by researchers. When aggregated at appropriate spatial–temporal scales and in a culturally appropriate manner, observations of resource users are a valuable source of ecological information. Continued development of creative analytical tools for synthesizing multiple knowledge sources will be essential for advancing the formal use of LEK in assessments of marine species.},

Thousands of published papers make it very clear that fish are on the move, alterations in productivity are occurring, and natural and human ecosystems are responding to climate variability and change. Across the globe, numerous high-level strategies have been developed to provide guidance for managing fisheries in the face of climate change, but specific examples of implementation and actionable decision making in real-world situations to address climate change impacts are generally lacking. Here we present a review of tangible actions that have been undertaken to reduce, mitigate, and confront climate change impacts to fisheries at a range of levels from individual choice to federal governance. Actions fall into seven general categories covering conservation of natural marine resources, emerging fisheries, reference points, future planning, integrated monitoring and management, and increasing adaptive capacity across all levels. We found that diverse fishery actors around the globe, including managers, scientists, and industry, are taking actions to address climate impacts, but given the scale of the problem there are relatively few intentional, well-documented examples of tactical responses.},

Density analysis of trawl start locations demonstrated how fishing efforts increased and decreased in relation to habitat distribution and fishery management actions between 1995 and 2002. Trawl effort patterns exhibited significant interannual variability and were patchy in distribution. Tow end-point locations from 1998 to 2001 were retrieved from manual logbooks for five reference sites located in proximity to rocky habitat. Trawl towlines were mapped and demonstrated a marked enhancement of fine-scale fishing effort resolution. Spatial shifts in fishing intensity (measured as kilometres towed) away from rock habitat were evident at all reference sites after the footrope restriction, with an average reduction of 86\%. Some slight shifts into surrounding unconsolidated sediments also occurred. Our results indicate that the footrope restriction, in conjunction with associated landing limits, was effective in protecting rocky habitats from trawl fishing impacts. Continued spatial monitoring of trawl data would assist in fishery management assessment of conservation objectives for depleted groundfish and essential fish habitat protection.},

Regulatory measures can shift or reduce trawling over seafloor habitats and thus act as a tool to protect the longterm sustainability of groundfish by conserving Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) from fishing impacts. Our analysis reviews the spatial and temporal extent of trawl fishing effort over the Pacific coast seafloor in the framework of complex fishery management from 1999 to 2004. Coastwide trawl effort declined over these years, yet the remaining fishing effort changed in spatial extent and intensity and shifted between habitat types. The proportion of annual trawl effort on the continental shelf has increased. In recent years, trawl fishing effort has intensified along boundaries of depth-based spatial closures. This study emphasizes the benefits of increasing the spatial resolution of fishery data to better understand how fishing impacts on habitat are minimized, identifying locations of potential habitat recovery, and the implications of fishery management measures on EFH conservation.},

However, management boundaries tend to be static and determined by politically negotiated or historically identified population (or multi-species) units, which create a potential disconnect with underlying, dynamic population structure. The consequences of incoherent management and population or stock boundaries were explored through the application of a two-area spatial simulation–estimation framework. Results highlight the importance of aligning management assessment areas with underlying population structure and processes, especially when fishing mortality is disproportionate to vulnerable biomass among management areas, demographic parameters (growth and maturity) are not homogenous within management areas, and connectivity (via recruitment or movement) unknowingly exists among management areas. Bias and risk were greater for assessments that incorrectly span multiple population segments (PSs) compared to assessments that cover a subset of a PS, and these results were exacerbated when there was connectivity between PSs. Directed studies and due consideration of critical PSs, spatially explicit models, and dynamic management options that help align management and population boundaries would likely reduce estimation biases and management risk, as would closely coordinated management that functions across population boundaries.},

It would require the use of multiple disciplines and multiple objectives, dealing with technically unresolvable management problems of complex adaptive systems and expanding scope from management to governance. Developing the governance toolbox would require expanding into new kinds of interaction unforeseen by the mid-twentieth-century fathers of fishery science – governance that may involve cooperative, multilevel management, partnerships, social learning and knowledge co-production. In addition to incorporating relatively well-known resilience, adaptive management and co-management approaches, taking EBM to the next stage may include some of the following: conceptualizing EBM as a ‘wicked problem’; conceptualizing fisheries as socialecological systems; picking and choosing from an assortment of new governance approaches; and finding creative ways to handle complexity.},

In the case of the tropical tuna purse seine fisheries, a critical difficulty lies in the definition of an effective fishing effort, because fishermen use two different fishing modes (free swimming schools versus schools under fish aggregating devices) alternatively during the same trip. In this study, vessel monitoring system (VMS) data were used in an operational level to study and quantify the spatial dynamic of the tropical tuna purse seine fishing activity. A Bayesian state–space model allowed classifying VMS steps into three activities (fishing, tracking, and cruising), which were characterized by a small set of complementary spatial indicators. The dominant activity (49\%) was clearly the tracking of tuna schools within areas of aggregations. A hierarchical spatial organization of the three fishing activities was also evidenced. Fishing strategies described by the triplets of proportions of time devoted to each activity and interpreted as compositional data were modelled by the sum of a vessel effect and a seasonal effect.},

While a suite of life history traits are traditionally incorporated into management efforts due to their direct association with vulnerability to overfishing, spawning behavioral traits are seldom considered. We synthesized the existing biological and fisheries information of 28 fish stocks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to investigate relationships between life history traits, spawning behavioral traits, management regulations, and vulnerability to fishing during the spawning season. Our results showed that spawning behavioral traits were not correlated with life history traits but improved identification of species that have been historically overfished. Species varied widely in their intrinsic vulnerability to fishing during spawning in association with a broad range of behavioral strategies. Extrinsic vulnerability was high for nearly all species due to exposure to fishing during the spawning season and few management measures in place to protect spawning fish. Similarly, several species with the highest vulnerability scores were historically overfished in association with spawning aggregations. The most vulnerable species included several stocks that have not been assessed and should be prioritized for further research and monitoring. Collectively, the results of this study illustrate that spawning behavior is a distinct aspect of fish ecology that is important to consider for predictions of vulnerability and resilience to fisheries exploitation.},

  abstract = {Skates (Rajiformes: Rajoidei) are common mesopredators in marine benthic communities. The spatial associations of individual species and the structure of assemblages are of considerable importance for effective monitoring and management of exploited skate populations. This study investigated the spatial associations of eastern North Pacific (ENP) skates in continental shelf and upper continental slope waters of two regions: central California and the western Gulf of Alaska. Long-term survey data were analyzed using GIS/spatial analysis techniques and regression models to determine distribution (by depth, temperature, and latitude/longitude) and relative abundance of the dominant species in each region. Submersible video data were incorporated for California to facilitate habitat association analysis. We addressed three main questions: 1) Are there regions of differential importance to skates?, 2) Are ENP skate assemblages spatially segregated?, and 3) When skates co-occur, do they differ in size? Skate populations were highly clustered in both regions, on scales of 10s of kilometers; however, high-density regions (i.e., hot spots) were segregated among species. Skate densities and frequencies of occurrence were substantially lower in Alaska as compared to California. Although skates are generally found on soft sediment habitats, Raja rhina exhibited the strongest association with mixed substrates, and R. stellulata catches were greatest on rocky reefs. Size segregation was evident in regions where species overlapped substantially in geographic and depth distribution (e.g., R. rhina and Bathyraja kincaidii off California; B. aleutica and B. interrupta in the Gulf of Alaska). Spatial niche differentiation in skates appears to be more pronounced than previously reported.},

We describe efforts to support reducing rockfish bycatch in central California trawl fisheries by testing the efficacy of move-on rules on catch data from 2002 to 2010. Move-on rules are regulations or guidelines that trigger the temporary closure of a fishery in a targeted area when a bycatch threshold is reached, without the closure of the entire fishery. Move-on rules based on spatiotemporal autocorrelation (clustering) were effective in reducing bycatch with modest impact on target catch, removing between 35\% and 77\% of future hauls with bycatch within a specified distance and time of a bycatch-containing haul, while foregoing target catch by an average of 12\%. The spatial and temporal peak clustering scales show correlation with the level of schooling behavior by each species; however, the efficiency of the rules measured either in reduction in bycatch hauls or diminished target catch was not strongly affected by those aggregation behaviors.

  abstract = {Mass spectrometric measurement of DMS by atmospheric pressure ionization with an isotopically labeled standard (APIMS-ILS) is a sensitive method with sufficient bandpass for direct flux measurements by eddy correlation. Use of an isotopically labeled internal standard greatly reduces instrumental drift, improving accuracy and precision. APIMS-ILS has been used in several recent campaigns to study ocean-atmosphere gas transfer and the chemical budget of DMS in the marine boundary layer. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the method and errors associated with DMS flux measurement from ship platforms. The APIMS-ILS instrument used by most groups today has a sensitivity of 100–200 counts s−1 pptv−1, which is shown to be more than sufficient for flux measurement by eddy covariance. Mass spectral backgrounds (blanks) are determined by stripping DMS from ambient air with gold. The instrument is found to exhibit some high frequency signal loss, with a half-power frequency of ≈1 Hz, but a correction based on an empirically determined instrument response function is presented. Standard micrometeorological assumptions of steady state and horizontal uniformity are found to be appropriate for DMS flux measurement, but rapid changes in mean DMS mixing ratio may serve as a warning that measured flux does not represent the true surface flux. In addition, bias in surface flux estimates arising from the flux divergence is not generally significant in the surface layer, but under conditions of lowered inversion and high flux may become so. The effects of error in motion corrections and of vertical motion within the surface layer concentration gradient are discussed and the estimated maximum error from these effects is ≤18\%.},

A collapse from the currently attained strong to the weak mode would have severe impacts on the global climate system and further multi-stable Earth system components. Observations and recently suggested fingerprints of AMOC variability indicate a gradual weakening during the last decades, but estimates of the critical transition point remain uncertain. Here, a robust and general early-warning indicator for forthcoming critical transitions is introduced. Significant early-warning signals are found in eight independent AMOC indices, based on observational sea-surface temperature and salinity data from across the Atlantic Ocean basin. These results reveal spatially consistent empirical evidence that, in the course of the last century, the AMOC may have evolved from relatively stable conditions to a point close to a critical transition.},

The observed trends are consistent with advection of low-DO waters into the region, as well as decreased vertical oxygen transport following near-surface warming and increased stratification. Expansion of the oxygen minimum layer could lead to cascading effects on benthic and pelagic ecosystems, including habitat compression and community reorganization.},

Based on a mixed layer temperature budget, these anomalies were caused by lower than normal rates of the loss of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere and of relatively weak cold advection in the upper ocean. Both of these mechanisms can be attributed to an unusually strong and persistent weather pattern featuring much higher than normal sea level pressure over the waters of interest. This anomaly was the greatest observed in this region since at least the 1980s. The region of warm sea surface temperature anomalies subsequently expanded and reached coastal waters in spring and summer 2014. Impacts on fisheries and regional weather are discussed. It is found that sea surface temperature anomalies in this region affect air temperatures downwind in Washington state.},

On the one hand, data obtained from scientific surveys are not available all year through, but are considered to provide consistent yearly and spatially resolved abundance indices. On the other hand, on-board commercial data do cover the whole year, but generally provide a biased perception of stock abundance. The combination of scientific and commercial catches per unit of effort (CPUEs), standardized using a delta-generalized linear model, allowed to infer spatial and monthly dynamics of fish distributions in the EEC, which could be compared with previous knowledge on their life cycles. Considering the scientific survey as a repository, the degree of reliability of commercial CPUEs was assessed with survey-based distribution using the Local Index of Collocation. Large scale information was in agreement with literature, especially for cuttlefish. Fine scale consistency between survey and commercial data was significant for half of the 19 tested species (e.g. whiting, cod). For the other species (e.g. plaice, thornback ray), the results were inconclusive, mainly owing to poor commercial data coverage and/or to particular aspects of the species biology.},

A decades-old hypothesis proposes that global warming will accelerate these upwelling favorable winds. Recent analyses provide empirical support for upwelling intensification in the poleward portion of the CCS. However, these studies rely on proxies for upwelling and are limited in their ability to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. Here we estimate simulated changes in CCS upwelling from 1920 to 2100 using monthly output from a single climate model ensemble, where divergences among simulations can be attributed entirely to internal climate variability. Our projections suggest that CCS upwelling will become more intense in the spring and less intense in the summer as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Anthropogenic changes in upwelling will emerge primarily in the second half of the century.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies are critical components of the ocean’s “internal weather” system. Mixing and stirring by eddies exerts significant control on biogeochemical fluxes in the open ocean, and eddies may trap distinctive plankton communities that remain coherent for months and can be transported hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Debate regarding how and why predators use fronts and eddies, for example as a migratory cue, enhanced forage opportunities, or preferred thermal habitat, has been ongoing since the 1950s. The influence of eddies on the behavior of large pelagic fishes, however, remains largely unexplored. Here, we reconstruct movements of a pelagic predator, the blue shark (               Prionace glauca               ), in the Gulf Stream region using electronic tags, earth-observing satellites, and data-assimilating ocean forecasting models. Based on {$>$}2,000 tracking days and nearly 500,000 high-resolution time series measurements collected by 15 instrumented individuals, we show that blue sharks seek out the interiors of anticyclonic eddies where they dive deep while foraging. Our observations counter the existing paradigm that anticyclonic eddies are unproductive ocean “deserts” and suggest anomalously warm temperatures in these features connect surface-oriented predators to the most abundant fish community on the planet in the mesopelagic. These results also shed light on the ecosystem services provided by mesopelagic prey. Careful consideration will be needed before biomass extraction from the ocean twilight zone to avoid interrupting a key link between planktonic production and top predators. Moreover, robust associations between targeted fish species and oceanographic features increase the prospects for effective dynamic ocean management.},

Use of commercial fishery data allows our model to capture the influence of biological and environmental effects as well as behavioral responses of crabbers to changing natural and regulatory conditions on CPUE. However, data deficiencies present a variety of estimation challenges, especially when the data are derived from neither a contemporaneous nor a scientifically designed sample of the fleet. A statistical framework for dealing with such challenges is illustrated in this paper. This research uncovered three major results. First, data pooling guided by recursive estimation/hypothesis testing is shown to be essential. Second, the analysis provides insight into CPUE response to changing conditions, whether biological, ecological, or policy induced. Third, it is apparent that more complete and contemporaneous collection of commercial fisheries data is critical to refine the estimation of CPUE – soak time relationships. Then, it may be possible to isolate the inter- and intra-seasonal influence of biological and environmental effects as well as behavioral responses of crabbers to changing natural and regulatory conditions.},

  abstract = {Accurate forecasts of how animals respond to climate-driven environmental change are needed to prepare for future redistributions, however, it is unclear which temporal scales of environmental variability give rise to predictability of species distributions. We examined the temporal scales of environmental variability that best predicted spatial abundance of a marine predator, swordfish Xiphias gladius, in the California Current. To understand which temporal scales of environmental variability provide biological predictability, we decomposed physical variables into three components: a monthly climatology (long-term average), a low frequency component representing interannual variability, and a high frequency (sub-annual) component that captures ephemeral features. We then assessed each component's contribution to predictive skill for spatially-explicit swordfish catch. The monthly climatology was the primary source of predictability in swordfish spatial catch, reflecting the spatial distribution associated with seasonal movements in this region. Importantly, we found that the low frequency component (capturing interannual variability) provided significant skill in predicting anomalous swordfish distribution and catch, which the monthly climatology cannot. The addition of the high frequency component added only minor improvement in predictability. By examining models' ability to predict species distribution anomalies, we assess the models in a way that is consistent with the goal of distribution forecasts – to predict deviations of species distributions from their average historical locations. The critical importance of low frequency climate variability in describing anomalous swordfish distributions and catch matches the target timescales of physical climate forecasts, suggesting potential for skillful ecological forecasts of swordfish distributions across short (seasonal) and long (climate) timescales. Understanding sources of prediction skill for species environmental responses gives confidence in our ability to accurately predict species distributions and abundance, and to know which responses are likely less predictable, under future climate change. This is important as climate change continues to cause an unprecedented redistribution of life on Earth.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty in fish behavior can introduce bias into density calculations from fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys that provide relative abundance estimates and population trends for stock assessments. In situ video was used to quantify flatfish behavioral responses to a bottom trawl sweep to improve the understanding of survey and assessment results. The behavior of 632 flatfishes was recorded during four tows. More than 90\% of fish were observed in a perpendicular orientation away from the sweeps indicating a herding response. There was no significant effect of fish length on fish orientation or whether it reacted or remained stationary during the observation. Only 1.3\% of fish were observed escaping the sweeps. A generalized linear model was used to estimate that at a distance of 73.8 cm (±3.4 SE) 50\% of observed fish reacted to the sweep. The mean distance that stationary fish were first observed reacting to the sweep was 36.6 cm (±2.0 SE). Quantitative analysis indicates that flatfish herding occurs along trawl sweeps and the effective area swept is greater than the wing spread. Thus, the use of wing spread to calculate relative abundance estimates explains bias in stock assessment estimates of survey catchability that are greater than expected.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1041–1054 Abstract Two major approaches address the need to predict species distributions in response to environmental changes. Correlative models estimate parameters phenomenologically by relating current distributions to environmental conditions. By contrast, mechanistic models incorporate explicit relationships between environmental conditions and organismal performance, estimated independently of current distributions. Mechanistic approaches include models that translate environmental conditions into biologically relevant metrics (e.g. potential duration of activity), models that capture environmental sensitivities of survivorship and fecundity, and models that use energetics to link environmental conditions and demography. We compared how two correlative and three mechanistic models predicted the ranges of two species: a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris) and a fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Correlative and mechanistic models performed similarly in predicting current distributions, but mechanistic models predicted larger range shifts in response to climate change. Although mechanistic models theoretically should provide more accurate distribution predictions, there is much potential for improving their flexibility and performance.},

Here, analysis of historical estuarine water quality data indicates regional “hot spots” of change. Galveston Bay and Oso Bay, which have highly urbanized watersheds, currently exhibit symptoms of eutrophication. Symptoms of eutrophication were also found in the Baffin Bay-Upper Laguna Madre complex, which has a sparsely populated but agriculturally-intensive watershed. Increasing salinity was observed in estuaries of the central Texas coast and are attributed to long-term decreases in freshwater inflow. Another artifact of decreasing freshwater inflow is a reduction in the delivery of carbonate minerals to estuaries, which manifests as decreases in pH. With findings from this study, targeted studies can now be directed at the estuaries that are experiencing water quality degradation in order to guide future management efforts.},

  abstract = {In principle, the spatial extent of fishery stock assessment should reflect the biological population, and major fishing patterns or population heterogeneity within the area should be represented. However, these theoretical requirements are commonly dismissed in practice, often when there is compelling evidence that spatial scope and structure is mis-specified and without testing if the mis-specified model performs well for informing fishery management. Population dynamics theory, case studies in fishery management as well as simulation tests demonstrate that accurately accounting for spatial structure in stock assessments can improve model performance, and ignoring spatial structure can lead to misperceptions of stock status and failures in fisheries management. Therefore, the development of stock assessment applications should include an evaluation of the most appropriate spatial scope and structure. Some common challenges in defining and modeling spatial structure can be addressed by adopting general best practices, but each species and its fisheries are unique. Accordingly, determining the most appropriate spatial structure involves 1) an interdisciplinary synthesis of all available information to determine the most plausible paradigms of population structure and fishing patterns, 2) the development of spatial operating models that are conditioned on these paradigms, and 3) testing the performance of estimation models and management strategies that are based on the current spatial management unit as well as alternative spatial scopes and structures that reflect population structure and fishing patterns.},

Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.},

  abstract = {Background Studies that attempt to measure shifts in species distributions often consider a single species in isolation. However, understanding changes in spatial overlap between predators and their prey might provide deeper insight into how species redistribution affects food web dynamics. Predator–prey overlap metrics Here, we review a suite of 10 metrics [range overlap, area overlap, the local index of collocation (Pianka's O), Hurlbert's index, biomass-weighted overlap, asymmetrical alpha, Schoener's D, Bhattacharyya's coefficient, the global index of collocation and the AB ratio] that describe how two species overlap in space, using concepts such as binary co-occurrence, encounter rates, spatial niche similarity, spatial independence, geographical similarity and trophic transfer. We describe the specific ecological insights that can be gained using each overlap metric, in order to determine which is most appropriate for describing spatial predator–prey interactions for different applications. Simulation and case study We use simulated predator and prey distributions to demonstrate how the 10 metrics respond to variation in three types of predator–prey interactions: changing spatial overlap between predator and prey, changing predator population size and changing patterns of predator aggregation in response to prey density. We also apply these overlap metrics to a case study of a predatory fish (arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias) and its prey (juvenile walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus) in the Eastern Bering Sea, AK, USA. We show how the metrics can be applied to understand spatial and temporal variation in the overlap of species distributions in this rapidly changing Arctic ecosystem. Conclusions Using both simulated and empirical data, we provide a roadmap for ecologists and other practitioners to select overlap metrics to describe particular aspects of spatial predator–prey interactions. We outline a range of research and management applications for which each metric may be suited.},

We analysed a unique (large) collection of phytoplankton monitoring data covering 86 coastal sites distributed over eight regions in North America and Europe, with the aim of investigating common patterns in the seasonal timing and species composition of the blooms. The spring bloom was the most common seasonal pattern across all regions, typically occurring early (February–March) at lower latitudes and later (April–May) at higher latitudes. Bloom frequency, defined as the probability of unusually high biomass, ranged from 5 to 35\% between sites and followed no consistent patterns across gradients of latitude, temperature, salinity, water depth, stratification, tidal amplitude or nutrient concentrations. Blooms were mostly dominated by a single species, typically diatoms (58\% of the blooms) and dinoflagellates (19\%). Diatom-dominated spring blooms were a common feature in most systems, although dinoflagellate spring blooms were also observed in the Baltic Sea. Blooms dominated by chlorophytes and cyanobacteria were only common in low salinity waters and occurred mostly at higher temperatures. Key bloom species across the eight regions included the diatoms Cerataulina pelagica and Dactyliosolen fragilissimus and dinoflagellates Heterocapsa triquetra and Prorocentrum cordatum. Other frequent bloom-forming taxa were diatom genera Chaetoceros, Coscinodiscus, Skeletonema, and Thalassiosira. Our meta-analysis shows that these 86 estuarine-coastal sites function as diatom-producing systems, the timing of that production varies widely, and that bloom frequency is not associated with environmental factors measured in monitoring programs. We end with a perspective on the limitations of conclusions derived from meta-analyses of phytoplankton time series, and the grand challenges remaining to understand the wide range of bloom patterns and processes that select species as bloom dominants in coastal waters.},

Despite its importance in the global carbon cycle, the biological processes that control BCPeff are poorly known. We investigate the potential role that zooplankton play in the biological carbon pump using both in situ observations and model output. Observed and modelled estimates of fast, slow, and total sinking fluxes are presented from three oceanic sites: the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the temperate North Atlantic, and the equatorial Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). We find that observed particle export efficiency is inversely related to primary production likely due to zooplankton grazing, in direct contrast to the model estimates. The model and observations show strongest agreement in remineralization coefficients and BCPeff at the OMZ site where zooplankton processing of particles in the mesopelagic zone is thought to be low. As the model has limited representation of zooplankton-mediated remineralization processes, we suggest that these results point to the importance of zooplankton in setting BCPeff, including particle grazing and fragmentation, and the effect of diel vertical migration. We suggest that improving parameterizations of zooplankton processes may increase the fidelity of biogeochemical model estimates of the biological carbon pump. Future changes in climate such as the expansion of OMZs may decrease the role of zooplankton in the biological carbon pump globally, hence increasing its efficiency.},

  abstract = {Studies in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have documented the potential importance of consumers on ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics. This is especially true when aggregations of organisms create biogeochemical hotspots through nutrient consumption, assimilation, and remineralization via excretion and egestion. Here, we focused on aggregations of humans in cities to examine how diet and waste management interact to drive nitrogen- (N) and phosphorus- (P) fluxes into nutrient pollution, inert forms, and nutrient recycling. We constructed six diet patterns (five US-based and one developing nation) to examine N- and P-consumption and excretion, and explored their implications for human health. Next, we constructed six waste-management patterns (three US and three for developing nations) to model how decisions at household and city scales determine the eventual fates of N and P. When compared to the US Recommended Daily Intake, all US diet patterns exceeded N and P requirements. Other than the “enriched CO2 environment scenario” diet, the typical US omnivore had the greatest excess (37\% N and 62\% P). Notably, P from food additives could account for all of the excess P found in US omnivore and vegetarian diets. Across all waste-management approaches, a greater proportion of P was stored or recycled (0 to {$>$} 100\% more P than N) and a greater proportion of N was released as effluent (20 to {$>$} 100\% more N than P) resulting in pollution enriched with N and a recycling stream enriched with P. In developing nations, 60\% of N and 50\% of P from excreta entered the environment as pollution because of a lack of sanitation infrastructure. Our study demonstrates a novel addition to modeling sustainable scenarios for urban N- and P-budgets by linking human diets and waste management through socio-ecological systems.},

The distribution of OA exposure across these early-impact systems, however, is highly uncertain and limits our understanding of whether and how spatial management actions can be deployed to ameliorate future impacts. Through a novel coastal OA observing network, we have uncovered a remarkably persistent spatial mosaic in the penetration of acidified waters into ecologically-important nearshore habitats across 1,000\,km of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In the most severe exposure hotspots, suboptimal conditions for calcifying organisms encompassed up to 56\% of the summer season, and were accompanied by some of the lowest and most variable pH environments known for the surface ocean. Persistent refuge areas were also found, highlighting new opportunities for local adaptation to address the global challenge of OA in productive coastal systems.},

  abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) is forced by the distribution of atmospheric pressure and associated winds in relation to the west coast of North America. In this paper, we begin with a simplified case of winds and a linear coast, then consider variability characteristic of the CCS, and conclude by considering future change. The CCS extends from the North Pacific Current (∼50°N) to off Baja California, Mexico (∼15–25°N) with a major discontinuity at Point Conception (34.5°N). Variation in atmospheric pressure affects winds and thus upwelling. Coastal, wind-driven upwelling results in nutrification and biological production and a southward coastal jet. Offshore, curl-driven upwelling results in a spatially large, productive habitat. The California Current flows equatorward and derives from the North Pacific Current and the coastal jet. Dominant modes of spatial and temporal variability in physical processes and biological responses are discussed. High surface production results in deep and bottom waters depleted in oxygen and enriched in carbon dioxide. Fishing has depleted demersal stocks more than pelagic stocks, and marine mammals, including whales, are recovering. Krill, squid, and micronekton are poorly known and merit study. Future climate change will differ from past change and thus prediction of the CCS requires an understanding of its dynamics. Of particular concern are changes in winds, stratification, and ocean chemistry.},

  abstract = {Marine life is being affected by changes in ocean conditions resulting from changes in climate and chemistry triggered by combustion of fossil fuels. Shifting spatial distributions of fish species is a major observed and predicted impact of these oceanographic changes, and such shifts may modify fish community structure considerably in particular locations and regions. We projected future range shifts of pelagic marine fishes of the Northeast Pacific shelf seas by 2050 relative to the present. We combined published data, expert knowledge, and pelagic fish survey data to predict current species distribution ranges of 28 fish species of the Northeast Pacific shelf seas that occur in the epipelagic zone and are well-represented in pelagic fish surveys. These represent a wide spectrum of sub-tropical to sub-polar species, with a wide range of life history characteristics. Using projected ocean condition changes from three different Earth System Models, we simulated changes in the spatial distribution of each species. We show that Northeast Pacific shelf seas may undergo considerable changes in the structure of its pelagic marine communities by mid-21st century. Ensembles of model projections suggest that the distribution centroids of the studied species are expected to shift poleward at an average rate of 30.1±2.34 (S.E.) km decade−1 under the SRES A2 scenario from 2000 to 2050. The projected species range shifts result in a high rate of range expansion of this group of species into the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea. Rate of range contraction of these species is highest at the Aleutian Islands, and in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. We also predict increasing dominance of warmer water species in all regions. The projected changes in species assemblages may have large ecological and socio-economic implications through mismatches of co-evolved species, unexpected trophic effects, and shifts of fishing grounds. These results provide hypotheses of climate change impacts that can be tested using data collected by monitoring programmes in the region.},

  abstract = {Flatfishes (order Pleuonectiformes) are important to fisheries and contribute substantially to seafood production and people's livelihood. However, the sustainability of flatfish fisheries is being challenged by climate change, in addition to other non-climatic human stressors. There is an urgent need to expand our understanding of the vulnerability and risk of impacts of flatfishes and their fisheries to climate change, and identify possible options to moderate such impacts. In this paper, firstly, we explain the importance of ocean temperature and thermal characteristics of flatfishes in determining their biogeography. Secondly, we discuss the biological vulnerability of flatfishes in the world to climate change as indicated by quantitative indices estimated from a fuzzy logic algorithm. Thirdly, by presenting projections of future distribution and potential catches of exploited flatfishes from computer simulation models, we highlight specific regions and species that are expected to be most impacted by climate change. Finally, we discuss potential human interventions that could help reduce such impacts, including the potential for mariculture. This paper underscores the need for immediate actions to integrate climate change into flatfish conservation and fisheries management measures.},

  abstract = {An ocean model is used to examine and compare the forcing mechanisms and underlying ocean dynamics of two dominant modes of ocean variability in the northeast Pacific (NEP). The first mode is identified with the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and accounts for the most variance in model sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea surface heights (SSHs). It is characterized by a monopole structure with a strong coherent signature along the coast. The second mode of variability is termed the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). This mode accounts for the most variance in sea surface salinities (SSSs) in the model and in longterm observations. While the NPGO is related to the second EOF of the North Pacific SST anomalies (the Victoria mode), it is defined here in terms of SSH anomalies. The NPGO is characterized by a pronounced dipole structure corresponding to variations in the strengths of the eastern and central branches of the subpolar and subtropical gyres in the North Pacific. It is found that the PDO and NPGO modes are each tied to a specific atmospheric forcing pattern. The PDO is related to the overlying Aleutian low, while the NPGO is forced by the North Pacific Oscillation. The above-mentioned climate modes captured in the model hindcast are reflected in satellite altimeter data.},

Here, we present a model of the annual cycle in phytoplankton that recognizes that phytoplankton are not always mixed throughout the so-called ML, and that it is important to distinguish between the surface biomass and depth-integrated phytoplankton. Once these important distinctions are made, the annual cycles and blooms in surface and depth-integrated phytoplankton can be described straightforwardly in terms of the physical drivers and biotic responses.},

The sensitivity of the new parameters was tested by individual parameter perturbation (IPP) analysis. The model was applied to estimate individual and total cohort food consumption of age-0 pollock in two areas of high pollock density in the Gulf of Alaska during the summer of 1990. Total cohort consumption was compared with zooplankton biomass and production estimates for the same areas and times of the year. The model was also used to examine the bioenergetic implications of age-0 pollock diel vertical migration through a thermal gradient. During a 1-month bioenergetics simulation, individual daily consumption decreased from 16·0 to 6·0\% of wet body weight. Daily ration estimates corresponded well with independent field estimates of daily ration for the same areas and time of the year. Comparison of total cohort consumption with prey availability (production and biomass) indicated minimal potential for food limitation. Bioenergetic optimization of growth can be a potential benefit of diel vertical migration to age-0 pollock, however more information on prey density and distribution is needed to test this hypothesis thoroughly.},

Current analytical techniques, employed in population ecology, fail to explicitly include nonadditive interactions between internal and external variables, and therefore cannot efficiently address indirect climate effects. Here, we present the results of an analysis, employing specifically developed statistical methodology, on density-dependent survival of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) prerecruitment stages in relation to background environmental variables in the Gulf of Alaska. We found that spring winds and water temperature mediate the intensity of density-dependent survival from the eggs to the age-0 stage. Fall water temperature and juvenile pollock predator abundance mediate density dependence from the age-0 to the age-1 stage. The inclusion of such nonadditive and nonlinear effects in a population dynamics model improved our ability to simulate pollock recruitment. Our results point to the importance of understanding nonadditive and nonlinear interactions between external (climate) and internal factors in the presence of underlying environmental variation. These topics are discussed in the context of current research priorities in population ecology and conservation biology.},

We compared results from two generalized additive model (GAM) formulations: one assuming no change of egg distribution and phenology over the examined time series (stationary) and the other admitting such changes (nonstationary) across an epoch determined from the data. Results from both model formulations corroborate the existence of a high egg concentration in Shelikof Strait, historically the primary spawning area of pollock in the GOA. However, model results also highlight the presence of other secondary, and possibly transitory, centers of egg distribution at various locations along the shelf and slope regions of the GOA.},

  abstract = {Low freshwater inflow estuaries are common worldwide, yet our understanding of phytoplankton dynamics in these systems is limited compared to river-influenced estuaries. Combining 3 years of monthly sampling data with analysis of a lower frequency, multidecadal dataset, we examined nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics in Baffin Bay-Upper Laguna Madre, TX (USA), a low-inflow lagoonal estuary. During a low rainfall, high salinity period (corresponding with non-El Niño conditions), phytoplankton community biovolume was high and consisted of a near monoculture of the harmful “brown tide” organism, Aureoumbra lagunensis. With the onset of El Niño conditions, rainfall increased and salinity decreased. Other phytoplankton groups became more prevalent, namely diatoms and the mixotrophic ciliate, Mesodinium sp., while prevalence of A. lagunensis declined. Although El Niño conditions corresponded with increased inorganic nitrogen concentrations, this did not lead to a near-term (weeks-months) increase in phytoplankton biovolume, indicating that the stimulatory effects of nutrient pulses may have been countered by the decreased residence times associated with increased inflow. Overall, results demonstrate that low freshwater inflows, as well as high residence times and salinities, can lead to increased phytoplankton biomass and decreased phytoplankton diversity, despite relatively low external nutrient loadings. With future expansion of arid/semiarid regions and/or increasing human freshwater demands, Baffin Bay and similar systems may experience lower inflows, more pronounced hypersalinity, and presumably less diverse phytoplankton communities, potentially dominated by harmful taxa as seen here.},

We develop a generalized joint attribute model (GJAM), a probabilistic framework that readily applies to data that are combinations of presence-absence, ordinal, continuous, discrete, composition, zero-inflated, and censored. It does so as a joint distribution over all species providing inference on sensitivity to input variables, correlations between species on the data scale, prediction, sensitivity analysis, definition of community structure, and missing data imputation. GJAM applications illustrate flexibility to the range of species-abundance data. Applications to forest inventories demonstrate species relationships responding as a community to environmental variables. It shows that the environment can be inverse predicted from the joint distribution of species. Application to microbiome data demonstrates how inverse prediction in the GJAM framework accelerates variable selection, by isolating effects of each input variable's influence across all species.},

  abstract = {Since the 1960s, fisheries for groundfish other than Pacific halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis have caused an average of about 9,000 metric tons (mt, round weight) of halibut bycatch mortality every year, whereas annual directed catches of Pacific halibut have varied from 13,000 to almost 50,000 mt. About half of the bycatch consists of juvenile Pacific halibut caught in Alaska, some of which would otherwise migrate south and contribute to the fishery in British Columbia. These interceptions have long been a difficult issue for the United States and Canada. At recent levels of high juvenile abundance, the juvenile bycatch reduces coastwide recruitment by about 10\%. The resulting yield loss, plus bycatch of adult fish, reduces yield to the directed fishery by about 11,000 mt per year. Migration modeling indicates that the yield loss due to bycatch occurs almost entirely in the area where the bycatch is taken. In particular, bycatch in Alaska reduces Pacific halibut yields in British Columbia by, at most, a few percent. During the 1980s and early 1990s, annual quotas in the directed Pacific halibut fishery were reduced by an amount equal to, or sometimes greater than, the total Pacific halibut bycatch mortality, and the quota reduction was distributed among regulatory areas in proportion to Pacific halibut exploitable biomass. At present, the Pacific halibut quota in each regulatory area is reduced by the amount of adult Pacific halibut bycatch mortality in that area, and the target exploitation rate is adjusted downward (slightly) to offset the bycatch mortality of juveniles.},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi-species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C’. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.},

Building resilient social-ecological systems requires approaches that are robust to uncertainty and to regime shifts. Harvesting diverse portfolios of natural resources and adapting portfolios in response to change could stabilize economies reliant on natural resources and their markets, both of which are prone to unpredictable shifts. Here we use fisheries catch and revenue data from Alaskan fishing communities over 34 years to test whether diversification and turnover in the composition of fishing opportunities increased economic stability during major ocean and market regime shifts in 1989. More than 85\% of communities show reduced fishing revenues following these regime shifts. However, communities with the highest portfolio diversity and those that could opportunistically shift the composition of resources they harvest, experienced negligible or even positive changes in revenue. Maintaining diversity in economic opportunities and enabling turnover facilitates sustainability of communities reliant on renewable resources facing uncertain futures.},

Washington focused on economic development of coastal towns. California focused on payments to impacted individuals and cooperative fisheries research. While federal responses to fisheries disasters cost the government millions of dollars each year, they are rarely researched and poorly understood. The goal of this project was to document responses to the disaster (focusing on Oregon), explore useful comparisons, and extract possible lessons learned. Results indicate that people working in the fishing industry face many obstacles to leaving the fishery, and that aggressive, well-planned outreach programs are necessary for efforts to directly help members of the fishing community through fishery disasters.

The results do not indicate that one must have a consistent set of vessels over time to provide useful data, but rather that there is benefit to consistency even when the survey data are analyzed using advanced statistical models. Further research should be undertaken to quantify these benefits specifically to aid in contracting and bidding of survey vessels.},

On the US West Coast, previous groundfish assemblage analyses have focused either on particular species groups (i.e. Sebastes) or limited time frames and/or geographic regions within the groundfish fishery. The present study expands on previous work to identify groundfish assemblages across the full spatial extent of the West Coast groundfish fishery from 1977−2009, by using 2 fishery-independent trawl surveys. Species assemblages were identified using 2 clustering methods (partitioning analysis and hierarchical analysis) and 2 realizations of the data (presence-absence and log+1 transformed catch-per-uniteffort, CPUE). The analysis using presence-absence data provides information on species that cooccur while the CPUE data provides information on species that occur at similar magnitudes. Temporally and spatially persistent assemblages were detected by both clustering methods through most years. Assemblages identified using CPUE were often subsets of those identified using presence-absence, indicating that the members of an assemblage may occur together, but not necessarily at the same magnitude, a result that should be considered when choosing the clustering metric. Identification of species assemblages is applicable to bycatch models and informative when evaluating the implementation of spatial management measures, and thus germane to current challenges faced by marine resource managers.},

  abstract = {The task of assessing marine resources should begin with defining management units. Often this step is overlooked or defined at temporal scales irrelevant to management needs. Additionally, traditional methods to define stock structure can be data intensive and (or) cost prohibitive and thus not available for emerging or data-limited fisheries. We present an approach that uses commonly available fisheries data (catch and effort) to delineate management units for dynamically independent populations. Spatially explicit standardized indices of abundance are grouped using a two-step partitioning cluster analysis that includes abundance index uncertainty. This ‘‘management unit estimator’’ is tested via simulation and found generally to recover the true number of management units across data of different temporal length, sample size, and quality. Management units are then determined for four species with varying ecologies, fishery histories, and data issues that exemplify the challenges of applying this method to messy data sets. Defining management units via relative abundance incorporates changes in population connectivity in relation to current removals and environmental conditions and creates consistency of index use within assessments. The two-step clustering approach is simple and widely applicable to situations wherein the clustering metric contains uncertainty. Re´sume´ : La taˆche d’e´valuer les ressources marines devrait de´buter par une de´finition des unite´s de gestion. Cette e´tape est souvent ne´glige´e ou alors de´finie a` des e´chelles temporelles qui ne sont pas pertinentes aux besoins de la gestion. De plus, les me´thodes traditionnelles de de´finition de la structure des stocks peuvent exiger beaucoup de donne´es et (ou) repre´senter un couˆt inabordable et donc ne pas eˆtre accessibles aux peˆches en e´mergence ou aux peˆches pauvres en donne´es. Nous pre´sentons une me´thode qui utilise des donne´es de peˆche couramment disponibles (capture et effort) pour de´finir les unite´s de gestion chez des populations dynamiquement inde´pendantes. Une analyse de groupement avec partition en deux e´tapes qui inclut un indice d’incertitude de l’abondance sert a` regrouper des indices standardise´s d’abondance qui sont spatialement explicites. Cet « estimateur des unite´s de gestion » a e´te´ teste´ par simulation; il arrive ge´ne´ralement a` retrouver le nombre re´el d’unite´s de gestion dans des ensembles de donne´es diffe´rant par leur e´tendue temporelle, la taille des e´chantillons et la qualite´.

Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of ‘true’ population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at finer area scales defined by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly defining management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs.},

  abstract = {Understanding the habitat usage of a species is essential to assessing the impacts of human activities, conservation efforts, and management issues on that species. Whitemouth croaker, an important species in the artisanal fishery market, inhabits different habitats of the Patos Lagoon estuary year-round based on the stage of its life cycle. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that habitat preferences and changes in abundance during the life cycle influence the model outcomes in the study of species distribution. Additionally, we evaluated whether incorporating additional life stages within the model affected the outcome of what comprised the essential fish habitat. Our results showed that the model’s outcome was affected when temporal variability and additional life stages were considered. We suggest that variability in abundance and habitat preferences at different developmental stages must be considered when identifying essential fish habitat of species with complex life cycles, such as whitemouth croaker. Understanding these changes could improve conservation and management outcomes.},

For each fishery, we estimate current biological status and forecast the impacts of contrasting management regimes on catch, profit, and biomass of fish in the sea. We estimate unique recovery targets and trajectories for each fishery, calculate the year-by-year effects of alternative recovery approaches, and model how alternative institutional reforms affect recovery outcomes. Current status is highly heterogeneous—the median fishery is in poor health (overfished, with further overfishing occurring), although 32\% of fisheries are in good biological, although not necessarily economic, condition. Our business-as-usual scenario projects further divergence and continued collapse for many of the world’s fisheries. Applying sound management reforms to global fisheries in our dataset could generate annual increases exceeding 16 million metric tons (MMT) in catch, \$53 billion in profit, and 619 MMT in biomass relative to business as usual. We also find that, with appropriate reforms, recovery can happen quickly, with the median fishery taking under 10 y to reach recovery targets. Our results show that commonsense reforms to fishery management would dramatically improve overall fish abundance while increasing food security and profits.},

  abstract = {Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with complex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Evidence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed dispersal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differential postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental ecological processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.},

  abstract = {A primitive equation ocean general circulation model is used to investigate climate impacts in the North Pacific Ocean in the 1996 to 2003 period. The objective is to assess the model ability to reproduce observed modes of variability and study their impact in the northeast Pacific. This work is done within the framework of the U.S. Global Ecosystem (GLOBEC) Northeast Pacific Program studying the links between climate variability and ecosystem dynamics. Three large-scale events are considered: The 1997/1998 El Niño, the 1999 “regime shift,” and the 2002 cold/fresh subsurface anomalous water mass that was observed in the Gulf of Alaska and off the coast of Oregon. The circulation model is shown to generate the correct seasonal to interannual large-scale variability and is able to represent the climatic signals of interest in the eastern Pacific. We show that the influence of the 1997/1998 El Niño reached the coastal Gulf of Alaska and induced an increase in the upper ocean heat content along the coast of North America. An analysis of the sea surface temperature for the model years shows agreement between model and data in the representation of the 1999 shift to a cold phase in the eastern and northern North Pacific. Finally, using the model results, we speculate that the origin of the 2002 cold/fresh anomaly in the northeast Pacific was due to enhanced mixing during the preceding winter in the center of the Alaska gyre. Owing to anomalous changes in the density structure of the upper ocean, this water was able to move geostrophically toward the coast and it persisted in the northeast Pacific below the mixed layer the following year.},

  abstract = {The degree of match and mismatch in the time of larval production and production of their food has been put forward as an explanation of part of the variability in recruitment to a stock of fish. The magnitude of recruitment is not completely determined until the year-class finally joins the adult stock, and the processes involved probably begin early in the life-history of the fish when both their growth and mortality rates are high. The match/mismatch hypothesis is given in this chapter to cover the subsequent development through larval life up to metamorphosis, and possibly just beyond. The match/mismatch hypothesis has now been extended to the upwelling areas and oceanic divergences equatorward of 40° latitude on the basis that fish in these regions release batches of eggs more frequently when they are well fed and, more generally, that pelagic fish may modify their reproductive strategies such that they can feed and spawn at the same time. A delay in predation is of great importance, particularly when production peaks in early development. This model illustrates the difficulties that occur when growth and mortality are allowed to interact. On the other hand, there are three consequences of the match/mismatch hypothesis that are presented in this chapter. However, the limited conclusion drawn in this chapter is that, investigations of fish larvae should continue to be a part of the study of population dynamics of fishes.},

Rotary power spectra of the hindcast currents near NOAA mooring site M2 site fall within the 95\% confidence bounds for the observational spectra, except for a high bias in the counter-clockwise rotating component at 10 m depth in the high frequencies (periods {$<$}24 h). The model exhibits the most skill in reproducing anomalies of the integrated annual sea ice concentration and monthly subsurface (60 m depth) temperature fields, accounting for 85\% and 50\% of their observed variability. Analysis of the integrated ice concentration time series reveals evolution in the mean duration of ice-free waters (40 year trend of +6.8 days/decade) and changes in this parameter's variance with time. Correlation and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses reveal the primary temporal-spatial patterns of variability in the temperature and salinity fields over the Bering Sea and northern Gulf of Alaska for near-surface (0–20 m) and subsurface (40–100 m) depth layers. Correlation analysis between the EOF principal components and various climate index and observed time series shows that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, and the Bering Sea annually integrated ice area anomalies are important indices of thermohaline variability; the spatial structures of these modes give insight to their potential impacts upon the ecosystem. We identify a number of ecologically and economically important species whose temporal variability is significantly correlated with the identified spatial patterns.},

Catch per unit of effort, area-swept biomass estimates, and age and length compositions for 12 commercially important west coast groundfishes are presented to illustrate trends over the lO-year period. We discuss the precision, accuracy, and statistical significance of observed trends in abundance estimates. The influence of water temperature on the distribution of groundfishes is also briefly examined. Abundance estimates of canary rockfish, Sebastes pinniger, and yellowtail rockfish, S. Jlavidus, declined during the study period; greater declines were observed in Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus, lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, and arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias. Biomass estimates of Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and English, rex, and Dover soles (Pleuronectes vetulus, Errex zachirus, and Microstomus pacificus) increased, while bocaccio, S. paucispinis, and chilipepper, S. goodei, were stable. Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, biomass estimates increased markedly from 1977 to 1980 and declined moderately thereafter. Precision was lowest for rockfishes, lingcod, and sablefish; it was highest for flatfishes because they were uniformly distributed. The accuracy of survey estimates could be gauged only for yellowtail and canary rockfish and sablefish. All fishery-based analyses produced much larger estimates of abundance than bottom trawl surveys-indicative of the true catchability of survey trawls. Population trends from all analyses compared well except in canary rockfish, the species that presents the greatest challenge to obtaining reasonable precision and one that casts doubts on the usefulness of bottom trawl surveys for estimating its abundance.},

  abstract = {Aim Recently discovered deep phylogenetic gaps in coastal California marine taxa are geographically discordant with the provincial biogeographic boundary at Point Conception. This discordance runs contrary to the phylogeographic hypotheses that were derived from studies of coastal marine taxa in south-eastern North America. Here, I investigate the nature of the discrepant phylogeographic and biogeographic patterns in coastal California. Location Coastal south-western North America. Methods The scientific literature describing the phylogeography and biogeography of coastal California taxa was reviewed. Data describing life-history characteristics, habitat, and degree of phylogeographic structure were extracted and compared. The geographical distribution of phylogenetic breaks was compared with regional biogeographic data. Results All taxa were genetically variable. Those with greater dispersal ability generally had less phylogeographic structure. Although few taxa had very limited dispersal ability, many exhibited phylogeographic breaks within the California Transition Zone, a region of gradual species replacement between Oregonian and Californian biogeographic provinces. The most precisely resolved phylogeographic breaks were geographically concordant with peaks in the distribution of edge-effect species, which are strong indicators of environmental discontinuities, or ecotones. Moreover, these phylogeographic gaps, edge-effect species, and ecotones coincide geographically with Late Pleistocene faunal discontinuities and probable long-term physical barriers to gene flow. Main conclusions Contrary to prior inference, phylogeographic patterns in coastal California marine taxa are consistent with the phylogeographic hypotheses. The concordance of phylogeographic and biogeographic patterns in the coastal marine faunas of south-eastern and south-western North America, and also the Indo-Pacific, suggests that the phylogeographic hypotheses are generally applicable to many coastal marine settings. As such, they provide a framework for investigating and comparing patterns of evolution in disparate coastal marine faunas.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The World Conference on Stock Assessment Methods (July 2013) included a workshop on testing assessment methods through simulations. The exercise was made up of two steps applied to datasets from 14 representative fish stocks from around the world. Step 1 involved applying stock assessments to datasets with varying degrees of effort dedicated to optimizing fit. Step 2 was applied to a subset of the stocks and involved characteristics of given model fits being used to generate pseudo-data with error. These pseudo-data were then provided to assessment modellers and fits to the pseudo-data provided consistency checks within (self-tests) and among (cross-tests) assessment models. Although trends in biomass were often similar across models, the scaling of absolute biomass was not consistent across models. Similar types of models tended to perform similarly (e.g. age based or production models). Self-testing and cross-testing of models are a useful diagnostic approach, and suggested that estimates in the most recent years of time-series were the least robust. Results from the simulation exercise provide a basis for guidance on future large-scale simulation experiments and demonstrate the need for strategic investments in the evaluation and development of stock assessment methods.},

  abstract = {Summary. Geostatistics involves the fitting of spatially continuous models to spatially discrete data. Preferential sampling arises when the process that determines the data locations and the process being modelled are stochastically dependent. Conventional geostatistical methods assume, if only implicitly, that sampling is non-preferential. However, these methods are often used in situations where sampling is likely to be preferential. For example, in mineral exploration, samples may be concentrated in areas that are thought likely to yield high grade ore. We give a general expression for the likelihood function of preferentially sampled geostatistical data and describe how this can be evaluated approximately by using Monte Carlo methods. We present a model for preferential sampling and demonstrate through simulated examples that ignoring preferential sampling can lead to misleading inferences. We describe an application of the model to a set of biomonitoring data from Galicia, northern Spain, in which making allowance for preferential sampling materially changes the results of the analysis.},

  abstract = {Decadal fluctuations in salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, a variety of zooplankton taxa, and fish stocks in the Northeast Pacific are often poorly correlated with the most widely-used index of large-scale climate variability in the region - the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We define a new pattern of climate change, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and show that its variability is significantly correlated with previously unexplained fluctuations of salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll. Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale variations in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection – the fundamental processes controlling salinity and nutrient concentrations. Nutrient fluctuations drive concomitant changes in phytoplankton concentrations, and may force similar variability in higher trophic levels. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of fluctuations in the mechanisms driving planktonic ecosystem dynamics. The NPGO pattern extends beyond the North Pacific and is part of a global-scale mode of climate variability that is evident in global sea level trends and sea surface temperature. Therefore the amplification of the NPGO variance found in observations and in global warming simulations implies that the NPGO may play an increasingly important role in forcing global-scale decadal changes in marine ecosystems.},

We present evidence that these variations are linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO)—a climate mode of variability that tracks changes in strength of the central and eastern branches of the North Pacific gyres and of the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE). The NPGO emerges as the leading mode of low-frequency variability for salinity and nutrients. We reconstruct the spatial expressions of the salinity and nutrient modes over the northeast Pacific using a regional ocean model hindcast from 1963-2004. These modes exhibit a large-scale coherent pattern that predicts the in-phase relationship between the Alaskan Gyre and California Current timeseries. The fact that large-amplitude, low-frequency fluctuations in salinity and nutrients are spatially phase-locked and correlated with a measurable climate index (the NPGO) open new avenues for exploring and predicting the effects of long-term climate change on marine ecosystem dynamics.},

Here we combine observations with an ensemble of climate model simulations to show that teleconnections between the North Pacific and the weak 2014/2015 El Niño linked the atmospheric forcing patterns of this event. These teleconnection dynamics from the extratropics to the tropics during winter 2013/14, and then back to the extratropics during winter 2014/15, are a key source of multi-year persistence of the North Pacific atmosphere. The corresponding ocean anomalies map onto known patterns of North Pacific decadal variability, specifically the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) in 2014 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 2015. A large ensemble of climate model simulations predicts that the winter variance of the NPGO- and PDO-like patterns increases under greenhouse forcing, consistent with other studies suggesting an increase in the atmospheric extremes that lead to drought over North America.},

  abstract = {In ecology, the true causal structure for a given problem is often not known, and several plausible models and thus model predictions exist. It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model's predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, Arrowtooth Flounder (Atheresthes stomias) has been the most abundant groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska and an apex predator with trophic links to many pelagic and benthic species. Its abundance and trophic status implies that a small change in survival may result in substantial uncertainty in the ecosystem, with potentially large effects across multiple species. A synthesis of Arrowtooth Flounder ecology in the Gulf of Alaska was undertaken to determine exposure to the environment during different life history stages, and to develop hypotheses regarding population response to environmental forcing. Historical data sets were used to identify mechanisms of interaction with the pelagic environment during the egg and larval phase, assess habitat utilization and trophic interactions from early settlement through adult life, and evaluate sensitivity and potential response of the population to climate-induced variability in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem. Modeling approaches include Individual-Based Modeling of the planktonic drift phase from spawning to settlement, Generalized Additive Modeling to examine the effects of location, bottom temperature, and depth on the distribution and density of different size categories of fish, and Habitat Suitability Modeling which integrates presence-absence and environmental data to develop predictive maps of suitable habitat for early juveniles, late juveniles, and adults. A strategy of high endurance characterizes the early ontogeny phase. Spawning and hatching occur during winter in deep water where predation risk is relatively low, and cold temperatures along with intrinsically low metabolic rates ensure extended availability of yolk reserves, lowering the risk of larval starvation in a food-poor environment. Larval duration and drift is protracted, contributing to widespread delivery of larvae to coastal, continental shelf and slope waters throughout the Gulf of Alaska, as well as expected transportation into the Bering Sea through the Aleutian Island Passes. Connectivity between spawning and settlement areas is less directed and juveniles are more ubiquitous across depths than previously understood. Juvenile and adult Arrowtooth Flounder are habitat and prey generalists, with some ontogenetic shifts apparent. Based on this comprehensive ecological synthesis, a preliminary climate-related vulnerability assessment indicates low risk, high resilience overall for this species in the Gulf of Alaska. However, some stage-specific sensitivity is hypothesized primarily relating to the potential for exacerbated temporal mis-match between early larvae and suitable zooplankton prey with increased temperatures. Density-dependent effects during the juvenile to adult stage may constrain further increases in Arrowtooth Flounder biomass in the Gulf of Alaska. This comprehensive ecological approach to assessing environmental sensitivities across life history stages for a commercially and ecologically important fish species has substantial merit for furthering the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, especially in marine ecosystems where there are robust sampling programs across trophic levels.},

Direct covariance estimates of momentum fluxes were collected in all four experiments and wind profiles were collected during three of them. The objective of the investigation is to improve parameterizations of the surface roughness and drag coefficient used to estimate the surface stress from bulk formulas. Specifically, the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) 3.0 bulk flux algorithm is refined to create COARE 3.5. Oversea measurements of dimensionless shear are used to investigate the stability function under stable and convective conditions. The behavior of surface roughness is then investigated over a wider range of wind speeds (up to 25 m s\textsuperscript{−1}) and wave conditions than have been available from previous oversea field studies. The wind speed dependence of the Charnock coefficient α in the COARE algorithm is modified to {$<$}inline-formula xmlns:ifp="http://www.ifactory.com/press"{$><$}img src="jpo-d-12-0173.1-inf1.gif"{$><$}/img{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$}, where {$<$}em{$>$}m{$<$}/em{$>$} = 0.017 m\textsuperscript{−1} s and {$<$}em{$>$}b{$<$}/em{$>$} = −0.005. When combined with a parameterization for smooth flow, this formulation gives better agreement with the stress estimates from all of the field programs at all winds speeds with significant improvement for wind speeds over 13 m s\textsuperscript{−1}. Wave age– and wave slope–dependent parameterizations of the surface roughness are also investigated, but the COARE 3.5 wind speed–dependent formulation matches the observations well without any wave information. The available data provide a simple reason for why wind speed–, wave age–, and wave slope–dependent formulations give similar results—the inverse wave age varies nearly linearly with wind speed in long-fetch conditions for wind speeds up to 25 m s\textsuperscript{−1}.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The overall objective of these indicators is to provide a low cost, easily accessible and rapid assessment tool that measures an overall status of a particular fishery anywhere in the world where all three sustainability pillars; ecology, community, and economics are considered [2]. The eight case studies that follow this introduction are the result of a collaboration between researchers at the Institute for Sustainable Food Systems at the University of Florida, researchers and colleagues around the world and the Environment for Development (EfD) Global Hub at University of Gothenburg. EfD is a global network of environmental economics research centers aiming at effective management of the environment in the Global South. The rest of this introduction is organized in the following manner. The next section gives a brief introduction to FPIs, the third section provides a quick background to EfD, its Marine research program and how the FPIs were developed, Section 4 has an overview and some descriptive data from the 149 fisheries currently in the FPI data base, Section 5 gives an overview of the eight new case studies, and the last section concludes.},

  abstract = {Marine carbon dioxide (CO2) system data has been collected from December 2014 to June 2018 in the northern Salish Sea (NSS; British Columbia, Canada) and consisted of continuous measurements at two sites as well as spatially- and seasonally-distributed discrete seawater samples. The array of CO2 observing activities included high-resolution CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) and pHT (total scale) measurements made at the Hakai Institute’s Quadra Island Field Station (QIFS) and from an Environment Canada weather buoy, respectively, as well as discrete seawater measurements of pCO2 and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2) obtained during a number of field campaigns. A relationship between NSS alkalinity and salinity was developed with the discrete datasets and used with the continuous measurements to highly resolve the marine CO2 system. Collectively, these datasets provided insights into the seasonality in this historically under-sampled region and detail the area’s tendency for aragonite saturation state () to be at non-corrosive levels (i.e. {$>$} 1) only in the upper water column during spring and summer months. This depth zone and time period of reprieve can be periodically interrupted by strong northwesterly winds that drive short-lived (\textasciitilde 1 week) episodes of high-pCO2, low-pH, and low- conditions throughout the region. Interannual variability in summertime conditions was evident and linked to reduced northwesterly winds and increased stratification. Anthropogenic CO2 in NSS surface water was estimated using data from 2017 combined with the global atmospheric CO2 forcing for the period 1765 to 2100, and projected a mean value of 49 ± 5 µmol kg-1 for 2018. The estimated trend in anthropogenic CO2 was further used to assess the evolution of and pHT levels in NSS surface water, and revealed that wintertime corrosive conditions were likely absent pre-1900. The percent of the year spent above = 1 has dropped from \textasciitilde 98\% in 1900 to \textasciitilde 60\% by 2018. Over the coming decades, winter pHT and spring and summer are projected to decline to conditions below identified biological thresholds for select vulnerable species.},

  abstract = {Recent historic lows in sea ice and cold pool extent in the Bering Sea have been linked to large-scale biogeographic shifts in many demersal taxa. Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) are associated with the cold pool and thus may be especially prone to northward range contraction with continued warming. Data from the 1988–2019 National Marine Fisheries Service eastern Bering Sea (EBS) bottom trawl surveys were used to examine the effect of climate warming on snow crab thermal habitat use and spatial distributions. The northern Bering Sea (NBS) was also surveyed in 2010 and 2017–2019, allowing us to examine NBS snow crab demographic structure relative to potential climate-driven range contraction into the NBS. Across the time series, trends in temperatures occupied by snow crab were tightly coupled with average bottom temperatures in the EBS despite extreme temperatures in 2018–2019 that exceeded cold-water thermal preferences of juvenile snow crab. Furthermore, we found that increased temperatures and a reduced, more northerly cold pool extent resulted in a smaller area occupied by snow crab across different ontogenetic stages, although there was no evidence for a northward shift in centers of distribution within the EBS. These findings suggest that the spatial extent and average temperature of snow crab distribution are likely constrained by the availability of cold water habitat in the EBS, and dramatic declines in juvenile snow crab abundance observed in 2019 may be attributed to potential direct or indirect temperature effects on survival of highly stenothermic early benthic stages of snow crab. Despite limited support for a directional range shift, survey abundance estimates indicated a \textasciitilde 600\% increase in abundance of larger size classes of male snow crab (≥61~mm carapace width) in the NBS between 2018 and 2019. Substantial shifts in juvenile abundances and NBS snow crab size structure in 2019 may have important management implications for the stock. While the increase in NBS mature male biomass may suggest the potential for a commercial fishery in more northern latitudes, concurrent declines in juvenile abundance suggest caution concerning the sustainability of the stock with continued warming.},

  abstract = {One of the largest warm water anomalies (marine heat waves [MHWs]) ever recorded occurred in the northeast Pacific during 2014--2016. This MHW was caused by large-scale atmospheric ridging and affected fisheries and ecosystems from Alaska through California, including a bloom of toxic algae spanning the entire coastline. Regional variations in MHW severity are common along coastlines worldwide but are generally unexplained. During the 2014--16 MHW, the summertime sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies were often stronger along the southern half of the coastline off the western continental United States. The reason for this north-south difference in severity of the MHW within the California Current System (CCS) has remained unclear. The scientific community's lack of understanding of regional variations within MHWs prevents accurate prediction of SST anomalies and resulting ecological and economic impacts. We show the north-south difference in SST anomalies was due to a known wind pattern determined by the coastline shape. The wind anomalies in summer have a quasi-dipole structure: the northern lobe extends southwest from Washington/Oregon, and the southern lobe has opposite sign and extends south from Cape Mendocino in a triangle due to a hydraulic expansion fan in the marine boundary layer. The alternating wind intensifications and relaxations typically last several days. However, the large-scale ridging during the MHW was associated with unusual persistence in this pattern: in summer 2015 a single wind relaxation in the southern lobe lasted two weeks. These wind anomalies induce changes in SST, likely via changes in wind-driven vertical entrainment of cold water from below the mixed layer, and mixed-layer shoaling; the net air-sea heat flux anomaly is small. The July 2015 wind relaxation persisted so long that the changes in SST exceeded pre-existing SST variations. The resulting SST anomalies have a dipole pattern similar to the wind anomalies. These dipole SST anomalies explain the north-south asymmetry in the CCS MHW. We suggest that during future persistent ridging events, the SST anomalies off the western continental U.S. will develop a north-south split structure similar to July 2015.},

  abstract = {Over the California Current upwelling system in summer, the prevailing upwelling-favorable winds episodically weaken (relax) or reverse direction for a few days. Near Pt. Conception, California, the wind usually does not reverse, but wind relaxation allows poleward oceanic coastal flow with ecological consequences. To determine the offshore extent and synoptic forcing of these wind relaxations, we formed composite averages of wind stress from the QuikSCAT satellite and atmospheric pressure from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) using 67 wind relaxations during summer 2000–2009. Wind relaxations at Pt. Conception are the third stage of an event sequence that repeatedly affects the west coast of North America in summer. First, 5–7 days before the wind weakens near Pt. Conception, the wind weakens or reverses off Oregon and northern California. Second, the upwelling-favorable wind intensifies along central California. Third, the wind relaxes at Pt. Conception, and the area of weakened winds extends poleward to northern California over 3–5 days. The NARR underestimates the wind stress within ∼200 km of coastal capes by a factor of 2. Wind relaxations at Pt. Conception are caused by offshore extension of the desert heat low. This synoptic forcing is related to event cycles that cause wind reversal as in Halliwell and Allen (1987) and Mass and Bond (1996), but includes weaker events. The wind relaxations extend ∼600 km offshore, similarly to the California-scale hydraulic expansion fan shaping the prevailing winds, and ∼1000 km alongshore, limited by an opposing pressure gradient force at Cape Mendocino.},

Research efforts and fisheries surveys have long sought to provide greater insights on both the environmental drivers, and the fisheries and ecosystem consequences, of this variability. Here, variability in the temporal and spatial abundance and distribution patterns of young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfishes are described based on midwater trawl surveys conducted throughout the coastal waters of California Current between 2001 and 2019. Results confirm that the abundance of winterspawning rockfish taxa in particular is highly variable over space and time. Although there is considerable spatial coherence in these relative abundance patterns, there are many years in which abundance patterns are very heterogeneous over the scale of the California Current. Results also confirm that the high abundance levels of YOY rockfish observed during the 2014–2016 large marine heatwave were largely coastwide events. Species association patterns of pelagic YOY for over 20 rockfish taxa in space and time are also described. The overall results will help inform future fisheries-independent surveys, and will improve future indices of recruitment strength used to inform stock assessment models and marine ecosystem status reports.},

  abstract = {Most current fishing practices are neither economically nor biologically sustainable. Every year, the world spends \$80 billion buying fish that cost \$105 billion to catch, even as heavy fishing places growing pressure on stocks that are already struggling with warmer, more acidic oceans. How have we developed an industry that is so wasteful, and why has it been so difficult to alter the trajectory toward species extinction? In this transnational, interdisciplinary history, Carmel Finley answers these questions and more as she explores how government subsidies propelled the expansion of fishing from a coastal, in-shore activity into a global industry. While nation states struggling for ocean supremacy have long used fishing as an imperial strategy, the Cold War brought a new emphasis: fishing became a means for nations to make distinct territorial claims. A network of trade policies and tariffs allowed cod from Iceland and tuna canned in Japan into the American market, destabilizing fisheries in New England and Southern California. With the subsequent establishment of tuna canneries in American Samoa and Puerto Rico, Japanese and American tuna boats moved from the Pacific into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans after bluefin. At the same time, government subsidies in nations such as Spain and the Soviet Union fueled fishery expansion on an industrial scale, with the Soviet fleet utterly depleting the stock of rosefish (or Pacific ocean perch) and other groundfish from British Columbia to California. This massive global explosion in fishing power led nations to expand their territorial limits in the 1970s, forever changing the seas. Looking across politics, economics, and biology, All the Boats on the Ocean casts a wide net to reveal how the subsidy-driven expansion of fisheries in the Pacific during the Cold War led to the growth of fisheries science and the creation of international fisheries management. Nevertheless, the seas are far from calm: in a world where this technologically advanced industry has enabled nations to colonize the oceans, fish literally have no place left to hide, and the future of the seas and their fish stocks is uncertain.},

Our reconstruction indicates that N\textsubscript{2}O emissions from land and ocean increased over the deglaciation largely in parallel by 1.7±0.3 and 0.7±0.3\&thinsp;TgN\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{−1}, respectively, relative to the Last Glacial Maximum level. However, during the abrupt Northern Hemisphere warmings at the onset of the Bølling–Allerød warming and the end of the Younger Dryas, terrestrial emissions respond more rapidly to the northward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone connected to the resumption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. About 90\&thinsp;\% of these large step increases were realized within 2 centuries at maximum. In contrast, marine emissions start to slowly increase already many centuries before the rapid warmings, possibly connected to a re-equilibration of subsurface oxygen in response to previous changes. Marine emissions decreased, concomitantly with changes in atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} and \emph{δ}\textsuperscript{13}C(CO\textsubscript{2}), at the onset of the termination and remained minimal during the early phase of Heinrich Stadial 1. During the early Holocene a slow decline in marine N\textsubscript{2}O emission of 0.4\&thinsp;TgN\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{−1} is reconstructed, which suggests an improvement of subsurface water ventilation in line with slowly increasing Atlantic overturning circulation. In the second half of the Holocene total emissions remain on a relatively constant level, but with significant millennial variability. The latter is still difficult to attribute to marine or terrestrial sources. Our N\textsubscript{2}O emission records provide important quantitative benchmarks for ocean and terrestrial nitrogen cycle models to study the influence of climate on nitrogen turnover on timescales from several decades to glacial–interglacial changes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize, and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size), and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions.},

However, the reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of online databases of environmental variables with global coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the species’ ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation statistics to identify models with no biological realism.},

  abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms are an important source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) in aquatic environments. Identifying the impact of pH on N2O production by ammonia oxidizers is key to understanding how aquatic greenhouse gas fluxes will respond to naturally occurring pH changes, as well as acidification driven by anthropogenic CO2. We assessed N2O production rates and formation mechanisms by communities of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in a lake and a marine environment, using incubation-based nitrogen (N) stable isotope tracer methods with 15N-labeled ammonium (15NH4+) and nitrite (15NO2-), and also measurements of the natural abundance N and O isotopic composition of dissolved N2O. N2O production during incubations of water from the shallow hypolimnion of Lake Lugano (Switzerland) was significantly higher when the pH was reduced from 7.54 (untreated pH) to 7.20 (reduced pH), while ammonia oxidation rates were similar between treatments. In all incubations, added NH4+ was the source of most of the N incorporated into N2O, suggesting that the main N2O production pathway involved hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and/or NO2- produced by ammonia oxidation during the incubation period. A small but significant amount of N derived from exogenous/added 15NO2- was also incorporated into N2O, but only during the reduced-pH incubations. Mass spectra of this N2O revealed that NH4+ and 15NO2- each contributed N equally to N2O by a ‘hybrid-N2O’ mechanism consistent with a reaction between NH2OH and NO2-. Nitrifier denitrification was not an important source of N2O. Isotopomeric N2O analyses in Lake Lugano were consistent with incubation results, as 15N enrichment of the internal N versus external N atoms produced site preferences (25.0‰ to 34.4‰) consistent with NH2OH-dependent hybrid-N2O production. Hybrid-N2O formation was also observed during incubations of seawater from coastal Namibia with 15NH4+ and NO2-. However, the site preference of dissolved N2O here was low (4.9‰), indicating another mechanism, not captured during the incubations, was important. Multiplex sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed distinct ammonia oxidizer communities: AOB dominated numerically in Lake Lugano, and AOA dominated in the seawater. Potential for hybrid N2O formation exists among both communities, and at least in AOB-dominated environments, acidification may accelerate this mechanism.},

  abstract = {Sparked by the observation that (i) many collapsed stocks have failed to recover despite the apparent prevalence of compensatory population dynamics and (ii) many stocks have a complex structure, we devised a simulation model illustrating that the underlying behavior of substocks is masked when the data are aggregated and evaluated at the scale of the management unit. The model consisted of several substocks within a stock complex, each having its own stock and recruitment (S–R) relationship with Allee effects. Incorporation of Allee effects into the S–R relationship was achieved by specifying a critical spawning stock biomass threshold below which no recruitment occurred. The simulation model revealed that it was possible for the aggregate S–R relationship to appear compensatory, even though no substock exhibited this behavior. If the conclusions we draw from our modeling are correct, biological reference points developed from aggregated data from multiple substocks and used in conventional fisheries management and stock assessment models are likely to be inaccurate and possibly nonconservative. More research in support of the delineation of substock structure, biophysical modeling, and metapopulation theory is advocated.},

  abstract = {1 We present a critical review of the application of metapopulation theory to the regional dynamics of plants. We consider whether there is evidence that regional populations of plants show a metapopulation structure. We then review the alternatives to the metapopulation regional population structure for plants. 2 Although metapopulation theory primarily deals with regional dynamics, it is, however, also commonly applied to patch dynamics within local populations (‘metapatch’ systems). These apparently analogous systems are very different: systems of patchy local populations do not exhibit the dissociation of processes operating at different spatial scales that is characteristic of metapopulations. 3 The parameters of classical metapopulation studies, such as colonization, re-colonization and extinction, may be hard to measure for many plant populations, in particular for populations with long-lived seedbanks. 4 The assumption of metapopulation theory that suitable habitat occurs as discrete patches within a matrix of unsuitable habitat is not always true, as regional populations of some species may exist on largely uninterrupted swathes of suitable habitat. Alternatively, suitable patches may be hard or impossible to define a priori. 5 Using detailed case studies from the literature we outline a possible classification of the spatial dynamics of plants at both regional and local scales. 6 At the regional scale we define: metapopulations, in the classic sense, where regional persistence is governed by the processes of patch colonization, extinction and recolonization; regional ensembles, systems of essentially unconnected local populations persisting in an ill-defined mosaic of suitable and unsuitable habitat; and spatially extended populations, essentially a single extended population occupying large tracts of suitable habitat, but whose regional dynamics are essentially a simple extension of local dynamics. 7 Although a range of forms of local spatial dynamics exist, these are qualitatively different from the forms of population structure at the regional level.},

  abstract = {Accounting for a warming ocean Fisheries provide food and support livelihoods across the world. They are also under extreme pressure, with many stocks overfished and poorly managed. Climate change will add to the burden fish stocks bear, but such impacts remain largely unknown. Free et al. used temperature-specific models and hindcasting across fish stocks to determine the degree to which warming has, and will, affect fish species (see the Perspective by Plagányi). They found that an overall reduction in yield has occurred over the past 80 years. Furthermore, although some species are predicted to respond positively to warming waters, the majority will experience a negative impact on growth. As our world warms, responsible and active management of fisheries harvests will become even more important. Science, this issue p. 979; see also p. 930 Climate change is altering habitats for marine fishes and invertebrates, but the net effect of these changes on potential food production is unknown. We used temperature-dependent population models to measure the influence of warming on the productivity of 235 populations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some populations responded significantly positively (n = 9 populations) and others responded significantly negatively (n = 19 populations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1\% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35\%. Outcomes of fisheries management—including long-term food provisioning—will be improved by accounting for changing productivity in a warmer ocean.

  abstract = {Observations of microbial contamination and particle suspensions represent valuable inputs to water quality models that form the basis of regulatory decisions regarding the use of surface waters. The Neuse River Estuary in eastern North Carolina is experiencing a decline in water quality due to increasing anthropogenic inputs. Potentially serious consequences of these inputs are the introduction and persistence of bacterial pathogenic organisms from human and animal waste. A critical factor in determining human health risk is the partitioning of these organisms between particle-attached and free-living cells in the water column. Particle-associated bacteria are generally less mobile in the environment, settle faster, and may have different rates of mortality than their free phase counterparts. Surface and bottom water samples were collected during both dry weather and storm events throughout the summer of 2004 to gage changes in particle concentration, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and the partitioning of two indicators of fecal contamination: Enterococcus sp. (ENT) and E. coli (EC). Increases in concentrations of these indicators coincided with increases in particles in suspension following storm events. In surface waters, both ENT and EC exhibited similar patterns, controlled primarily by runoff inputs (i.e., storms). In bottom waters, resuspension of sediments was additional source of particles and both indicators. Partitioning of these indicators between particle attached and free living exhibited an overall average of 38\% of bacteria associated with particles capable of settling out of the water column. This fraction compares well with previous estimates of attachment of indicators in stormwater. The ability to estimate attachment rates and characterize particle suspensions provides a powerful tool for management and assessment of water quality in estuaries.},

A robust and collaborative network of regional monitoring programs can detect early signs of unanticipated changes, provide a more holistic understanding of ecosystem responses, and prompt faster management actions. Fisheries-related surveys that collect fisheries-independent data (hereafter referred to as “fisheries surveys”) are a key pillar of sustainable fisheries management and are ubiquitous in the United States and other countries. From the perspective of ocean observing, fisheries surveys offer three key strengths: 1) they are sustained due to largely consistent funding support from federal and state public sector fisheries agencies, 2) they collect paired physical, biogeochemical, and biological data, and 3) they have large and frequently overlapping spatial footprints that extend into the offshore region. Despite this, information about fisheries survey data collection can remain poorly known to the broader academic and ocean observing communities. During the 2019 CalCOFI Symposium, marking the 70th anniversary of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), representatives from 21 ocean monitoring programs on the North American West Coast came together to share the status of their monitoring programs and examine opportunities to leverage efforts to support regional ecosystem management needs. To increase awareness about collected ocean observing data, we catalog these ongoing ocean time series programs and detail the activities of the nine major federal or state fisheries surveys on the U.S. West Coast. We then present three case studies showing how fisheries survey data contribute to the understanding of emergent ecosystem management challenges: marine heatwaves, ocean acidification, and contaminant spills. Moving forward, increased cross-survey analyses and cooperation can improve regional capacity to address emerging challenges. Fisheries surveys represent a foundational blueprint for ecosystem monitoring. As the international community moves towards a global strategy for ocean observing needs, fisheries survey programs should be included as data contributors.},

  abstract = {Marine fish populations exist in a complex environment, with oceanographic and fisheries factors affecting their dynamics. It has been shown that life history characteristics of marine fish vary in space and time. We examined spatial variability in growth of eight groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to identify shared spatial patterns and hypothesize about common mechanisms behind them. Growth parameters were estimated in different areas over the latitudinal range of the species, and several hypotheses were tested as to how these parameters vary along the US west coast. Clear differences in spatial growth variability emerged among the species examined. Shelf species exhibit the highest growth rate between Cape Blanco and Cape Mendocino, which may, in part, be attributed to area-specific upwelling patterns in the California Current ecosystem, when nutrient-rich deep water is brought to the surface south of Cape Blanco and is uniquely distributed throughout this area, providing favourable conditions for primary productivity. Slope species showed a cline in asymptotic size (L∞), with L∞ increasing from south to north. This cline, previously attributed to fishery removals, also fits a specific case of the widely described Bergmann’s rule, and we explore specific potential ecological mechanisms behind this relationship.},

Using a model for the early life stages of sablefish, we explored the variability in connectivity between spawning and recruitment sites that can arise solely from interannual variability in environmental forcing and its impact on transport. Our major findings are that 1) the model indicates young sablefish settling in nursery areas in the Gulf of Alaska were most likely spawned in the eastern Gulf; 2) sablefish spawned in the western Gulf of Alaska are unlikely to settle anywhere in the Gulf, and are more likely to be advected farther west, perhaps to settle in the Aleutian islands or Bering Sea (to contribute to the Alaska population, they would have to undergo an active return migration as they mature); 3) total connectivity between all spawning sites and nursery areas showed stronger correlation with recruitment estimates than the strength of connections to or from specific regions; and 4) transport to St. John Baptist Bay, a known sablefish nursery area, was not the most probable end point for sablefish spawned throughout our Gulf of Alaska model domain. This suggests that young individuals arrive at this persistent nursery area due to directional swimming behavior, highly localized spawning, or small-scale currents not captured in the hydrographic model. The fact that no single correlate in our analysis had a very strong relationship to sablefish recruitment indicates that recruitment variability arises from complex interactions between the environment and the individual, and a possible disconnect in spatial scales between the Gulf of Alaska sablefish IBM and the broader sablefish stock assessment, which includes both the GOA and the Eastern Bering Sea, as well as possible contributions from Canadian stocks to the south. Our analyses determined that although the timing and extent of this transport shows significant interannual variability, both the location of likely sablefish spawning (source) areas and the comparative strength of connectivity between spawning and nursery sites appear to be relatively consistent year-to-year.},

These regions are defined by extremely low oxygen concentrations ({$<$}20–45 μmol kg−1), cover wide expanses of the ocean, and are associated with productive oceanic and coastal regions. OMZs have expanded over the past 50 years, and this expansion is predicted to continue as the climate warms worldwide. Shoaling of the upper boundaries of the OMZs accompanies OMZ expansion, and decreased oxygen at shallower depths can affect all marine organisms through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Effects include altered microbial processes that produce and consume key nutrients and gases, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and shifts in the abundance and accessibility of commercially fished species. Although many species will be negatively affected by these effects, others may expand their range or exploit new niches. OMZ shoaling is thus likely to have major and far-reaching consequences.},

  abstract = {Private-sector financial and legal transactions have long been used to protect terrestrial habitats and working landscapes, but less commonly to address critical threats in marine environments. Transferrable and marketable fishing privileges, including permits and quotas, make it possible to use private-sector transactions as conservation strategies to address some fishery management issues. Abating the effects of bottom trawling on the seafloor and bycatch and discard associated with the practice has proven challenging. On the Central Coast of California, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Environmental Defense Fund, local fishers and local, state, and federal authorities worked collaboratively to protect large areas of the seafloor from bottom trawling for groundfish while addressing economic impacts of trawl closures. Contingent on the adoption of trawl-closure areas by a federal regulatory agency, TNC used private funds to purchase federal groundfish trawl permits and vessels from willing sellers. Trawl-closure areas were designed collaboratively by combining regional biological diversity and fisheries data with local fishers’ knowledge. The private transactional strategy was designed to remedy some deficiencies in previous federal buyouts, to mitigate economic impacts from trawl closures, and to carefully align with a public regulatory process to protect “essential fish habitat” under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This collaborative effort protected 1.5 million ha (3.8 million acres) of seafloor, reduced trawl effort in the area by 50\%, and set a precedent for collaborative partnerships between conservation and fishing interests. This is the first time a large conservation organization has taken an ownership position in a fishery and demonstrates how nongovernmental organizations can invest in fisheries to improve environmental and economic performance.

  abstract = {This report describes the state of the California Current System (CCS)—meteorological, physical, chemical, and biological—from January 2003 to the spring of 2004. The area covered in this report ranges from Oregon coastal waters to southern Baja California. Over the past year, most physical, chemical, and biological parameters were close to their climatological mean. Contributing to such “normal” conditions was the absence of a La Niña that had been expected after the previous year’s El Niño. Noteworthy, however, are the cold and fresh anomalies in the upper 100–200 m that have been found over large areas of the CCS since 2002. Off Oregon these may have been responsible for increased productivity; off southern California these were associated with shallower nutriclines and subsurface chlorophyll maxima in the offshore areas. It is unclear if these anomalies are ephemeral or related to long-term changes in ocean climate. The effects of the hypothesized 1998 “regime shift” on the CCS are still difficult to discern, primarily because of other physical forcing varying on different time scales (e.g., El Niño/Southern Oscillation, ENSO, cycles; the “subarctic influence”; global warming). The resolution of many of these issues requires larger scale observations than are available now. Establishment of the Pacific Coast Ocean Observing System (PaCOOS) under the guidance of NOAA will be a crucial step toward achieving that goal.},

Here, we investigate the diversity, abundance, and activity of diazotrophic microorganisms in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), a diazotrophic habitat, and the North Pacific Transition Zone (NPTZ), a region characterized by strong physical, chemical, and biological gradients. Samples were collected on two springtime meridional cruises during 2016 and 2017, spanning from 23.5N to 41.4N along 158W. We observed an abrupt decrease in diazotrophic abundances near the southern edge of the NPTZ, which coincided with a salinity front and with a \$10-fold increase in Synechococcus abundance, but without a concomitant change in phosphate or nitrate concentrations. In NPSG waters south of this diazotrophic boundary, nifH genes and NFRs were consistently detected and diazotrophic communities were dominated by UCYN-A, an uncultivated, symbiotic cyanobacterium (2.8 × 103 to 1.0 × 106 nifH gene copies L−1). There was a significant positive relationship between quantitative polymerase chain reaction-derived UCYN-A nifH gene abundances and community NFRs in the NPSG, suggesting a large contribution of UCYN-A to community NFRs. In the NPTZ waters to the north, NFRs were low or undetected and nifH genes were rare, with the few detected sequences represented by UCYN-A and noncyanobacterial diazotrophs. The patterns we observed in UCYN-A abundance in the context of local biogeochemistry suggest that the environmental controls of this organism may differ from those of cultivated marine cyanobacterial diazotrophs.},

Whereas anthropogenic nutrient loading has increased the frequency and severity of hypoxia in estuaries and semi-enclosed seas3,4, the occurrence of hypoxia in open-coast upwelling systems reflects ocean conditions that control the delivery of oxygen-poor and nutrient-rich deep water onto continental shelves1. Upwelling systems support a large proportion of the world's fisheries5, therefore understanding the links between changes in ocean climate, upwelling-driven hypoxia and ecological perturbations is critical. Here we report on the unprecedented development of severe inner-shelf ({$<$}70\,m) hypoxia and resultant mass die-offs of fish and invertebrates within the California Current System. In 2002, cross-shelf transects revealed the development of abnormally low dissolved-oxygen levels as a response to anomalously strong flow of subarctic water into the California Current System. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of inner-shelf ecosystems to variation in ocean conditions, and the potential impacts of climate change on marine communities.},

  abstract = {Polynyas are areas of open water in ice-covered seas, and are important sites for enhanced water column and benthic production in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Research on polynyas during the last twenty years has allowed multi-disciplinary evaluation of processes in various polynyas, including the Northeast Water (NEW) polynya, North Water (NOW) polynya, St. Lawrence Island polynya (SLIP), and the Bathurst (BATH) polynya in the Arctic, and the Ross Sea polynya (RSP), McMurdo Sound polynya (MSP), and Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya in the Antarctic. Several other coastal polynyas around Antarctica have received limited study. Studies of benthic patterns and processes in polynyas indicate that faunal biomass, productivity, and carbon cycling are dependent on depth, season, ice cover, carbon supply, and hydrographic forcing. Polynyas generally have high primary productivity, which typically supports rich benthic communities through enhanced vertical carbon flux. Short and long-term indicators can provide a “foot print” of water column processes within polynyas, such as sediment community oxygen consumption and benthic biomass. Although zooplankton production directly influences the retentive nature of carbon in the euphotic zone, depth is the critical factor for the impact of net carbon export to the underlying benthos. We use a simple modeling exercise of two polynya case studies, the SLIP in the Arctic and RSP in the Antarctic, to evaluate export efficiency and benthic carbon cycling. Depth ultimately influences whether a polynya is a “retentive” versus “export” ecosystem, impacting the underlying benthic populations and associated carbon cycling. Defining polynyas and marginal ice zones as retentive versus export systems is potentially a powerful tool for understanding polar shelf processes, particularly when primary production is not measured simultaneously with benthic parameters.},

The usefulness of the concept in terrestrial ecology is neither based on its simplicity or generality nor on overwhelming empirical evidence. The usefulness is in the questions which are asked when the metapopulation concept is applied. These questions address spatial phenomena and processes on different spatial scales. They help in acknowledging that every population, be it terrestrial or marine, has a spatial organization. Understanding this spatial organization is also important for tackling specific applied problems, i.e. to avoid overexploitation of living marine resources or for configuring marine reserves. The ‘openness’ of coastal populations, whose larvae enter larval pools or which are holoplanktonic, is no reason for not asking the questions implied by the metapopulation concept. For marine ecology, the real problem is to delineate populations, which then may possibly correspond to the ‘local populations’ of metapopulations. Thus, the answer to the question in the title of this paper, whether ‘marine metapopulation’ is a useful concept, is ‘yes’, if the concept is considered a working hypotheses, if the concept is explicitly defined, and if the questions linked to the concept are clearly stated. Even if it eventually transpires that only very few marine metapopulations actually exist, marine ecology would still have gained some important new insights.},

  abstract = {Fish populations undertaking ontogenetic or spawning migrations pose challenges to marine protected area (MPA) planning because of the large extent of their distribution areas. There is a need to identify the juvenile and spawner hotspots of these populations that could be set aside as MPAs. Species distribution models making comprehensive use of available monitoring data and predicting the realized juvenile and spawner hotspots of migratory fish populations will assist resource managers with MPA planning. We developed a statistical modelling approach relying on multiple, regional monitoring datasets for assisting spatial protection efforts targeting the juveniles, spawners, or both life stages, of migratory fish species and species complexes. This approach predicts juvenile and spawner hotspot indices, and critical life stage (CLS) hotspot indices, which integrate both juvenile and spawner hotspot indices. We applied the approach to 11 vulnerable species of the grouper–snapper complex of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which all form fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). The CLS hotspot index was predicted to be highest in the Pulley Ridge and Flower Garden Banks areas, followed by the West Florida Shelf, southwestern Florida waters and portions of the Louisiana-Mississippi-Alabama shelf. The Pulley Ridge Habitat Area of Particular Concern and Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary are two important existing MPAs of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, whose possible expansion is being considered. The predicted CLS hotspot indices suggest that expanding these MPAs or increasing harvest regulations within them would offer substantial protection to both the juveniles and spawners of many FSA-forming species of the grouper–snapper complex. Synthesis and applications. As the number of marine protected areas (MPAs) continues to increase worldwide, statistical modelling approaches making comprehensive use of available data are urgently needed to support resource managers’ abilities to establish sound and efficient spatial protection plans. The outputs of our statistical models can serve as inputs to conservation planning software packages seeking optimal marine protected areas configurations or can be directly employed by resource managers for formulating spatial protection plans.},

However, spatial considerations are generally ignored in fishery stock assessment and management because of a lack of spatially explicit data and poor understanding of the spatial dynamics of most fisheries. This study uses a simulation approach to evaluate the consequences of misspecifying spatial structure and migration during the assessment process. We developed an operating model to simulate a fishery using US Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as our model species. This population consists of two well-defined spawning substocks distributed and mixed in four management areas. Simulations were done for three alternative “true” populations, each having a different spatial structure both biologically and with regard to the geographic distribution of fishing effort. Stock assessments were then performed for the three simulated “true” populations using standard methodologies and assumptions currently used. Management-area-based assessments lead to overestimation of spawning stock biomass and underestimation of fishing mortality because of the interaction within the management area between the spatial structure of the population and that of the spatially heterogeneous fishery removals. In contrast, when fishing is spatially homogeneous, movement across management boundaries may not be relevant to modeling population dynamics. Such an idealized situation does not typically hold, however.},

While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150\,m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.},

However, users often underestimate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detection and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application’s objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

  abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species’ response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.},

  abstract = {Extensive trawl surveys were conducted in two large estuaries (Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay) on the Washington coast during 1983-1987, and in adjacent areas of the open coast. These surveys have shown that both English sole and Dungeness crab rely heavily on these estuaries as nursery areas, although the pattern of utilization differs substantially. Juvenile migration patterns can show substantial interannual variability and can only be delineated by concurrent surveys in both coastal and estuarine areas, conducted over a period of several years. English sole eggs and Dungeness crab larvae are released in coastal waters. Larvae of both species transform to the benthic stage in both coastal and estuarine areas, but most English sole eventually migrate into the estuaries during the first year of life, even if initial settlement is along the open coast. By the time English sole have attained a length of 55 mm (TL), most of them are found in estuaries. English sole begin emigrating from the estuaries at about 75 mm, and few remain there during the second year of life. In contrast, Dungeness crab appear to remain in the area of initial settlement throughout the first year of life. Growth is substantially faster in estuaries where 0+ crab reach a mean size of about 40 mm carapace width (CW) by September, with those off the coast are only about 14 mm CW. Juveniles remain in the area of settlement over their first winter but, in contrast to English sole, most coastal 1+ crab immigrate to estuaries to join siblings that settled there the previous year. By September of the second year, crab at about 100 mm CW emigrate to the open coast where they reach maturity. Advantages to juvenile stages that reside in estuaries are discussed in terms of accelerated growth at higher temperatures and potentially greater food supplies than found nearshore along the coast.}

  abstract = {We used a combination of seabird data (both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent) and fishing-effort data to evaluate the relative fisheries risk of five west coast groundfish fisheries and one shrimp fishery to black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes), short-tailed (P. albatrus) and Laysan albatrosses (P. immutabilis). To assess risk, an overlap index was derived as the product of total fishing effort and at-sea survey density of black-footed albatross. This index was used as the primary tool to estimate overlap with the endangered, relatively rare short-tailed albatross, which show similar habitat utilization from satellite telemetry tracks. Telemetry data indicate Laysan albatross primarily occur offshore beyond observed fishing effort. Black-footed and short-tailed albatross-fishery overlap was highest at the shelf-break (201–1000m) north of 36° N. Overlap and reported albatross mortality indicate that the sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) longline and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) catcher-processor fisheries pose the greatest risk to these species; the near-shore rockfish (Seabastes spp.) longline, pink shrimp (Pandalus jordani) trawl, California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) trawl, and non-hake groundfish trawl fisheries pose relatively little risk. Implementing proven seabird bycatch-reduction measures will likely minimize albatross mortality in the highest-risk fishery, sablefish longline.},

  abstract = {Large-scale climatic indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation1 are associated with population dynamics2, variation in demographic rates3 and values of phenotypic traits4,5 in many species. Paradoxically, these large-scale indices can seem to be better predictors of ecological processes than local climate5,6,7,8. Using detailed data from a population of Soay sheep9,10, we show that high rainfall, high winds or low temperatures at any time during a 3-month period can cause mortality either immediately or lagged by a few days. Most measures of local climate used by ecologists fail to capture such complex associations between weather and ecological process, and this may help to explain why large-scale, seasonal indices of climate spanning several months can outperform local climatic factors. Furthermore, we show why an understanding of the mechanism by which climate influences population ecology is important. Through simulation we demonstrate that the timing of bad weather within a period of mortality can have an important modifying influence on intraspecific competition for food, revealing an interaction between climate and density dependence11 that the use of large-scale climatic indices or inappropriate local weather variables might obscure.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates environmental drivers of U.S. West Coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step toward developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age-1 fish. First, a conceptual life history approach is used to generate life-stage-specific and spatio-temporally specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40 to 48°N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (a) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (b) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (c) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (d) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.},

The inert gas measurements constrain the flux of oxygen into the mixed layer from small, collapsing bubbles (injection) to be greater than or equal to the flux from larger bubbles (exchange), with mean estimates of the ratio in the range of 1–2. We also show that monthly observations of temperature and inert gases cannot constrain the rate of diapycnal mixing at this location, because of uncertainties in air-sea heat flux estimates and bubble dynamics. Organic carbon export from the mixed layer calculated from our dataset was 1.1 ± 0.5 mol C m−2 yr−1, with most of the error deriving from uncertainties in the parameterization of diffusive gas exchange with wind speed. Our estimates of carbon export from the zone beneath the mixed layer but still in the euphotic zone ranged from 0 to 0.6 mol C m−2 yr−1 as the rate of background diapycnal mixing was increased from 0.1 to 1.0 cm2 s−1. We conclude that the oxygen mass balance method has errors of about a factor of two in areas similar to the subtropical North Pacific, with the main uncertainties deriving from mixing rates and the parameterization of diffusive gas exchange.},

  abstract = {Fish populations have the potential to contribute to the long-term economic and social benefit of humans, but to do so they must be managed in ways which maintain ecological health. There are many ways that management performance can be assessed, but four measures are particularly pertinent to sustainability: equity, stewardship, regulatory resilience, and efficiency. A key factor in management performance is the process by which management tools are developed and implemented. One approach that has been recommended to improve performance is to structure the management process around user participation. The paper analyzes three case studies of user participation in ad hoc processes of Pacific groundfish management: the development of a license limitation program; an inter-gear sablefish allocation; and the development of a sablefish individual quota (IQ) program. The case studies illustrate the role played by participation in contributing to the equity, stewardship, resilience, and efficiency of the management process. The effect of user participation was mixed in the three cases, depending on the history of participation, the structure and process of participation, on resource conditions and on the characteristics of the program under consideration. Participation can contribute positively to fishery management performance when there is a history of collective decision-making, the time line is slow enough to allow a full consideration of the issues, educational possibilities are pursued and the condition of the resource allows equitable compromises.

Survival was measured using specialized sea cages for holding individual fish. The external physical signs associated with extreme expansion and retention of swimbladder gas (pronounced barotrauma), including esophageal eversion, exophthalmia and ocular emphysema, were common for both species at these capture depths and were more frequent than in prior studies conducted at shallower depths. Despite similar frequencies of most external barotrauma signs, 48-h post-recompression survival of the two species diverged markedly as capture depth increased. Survival of yelloweye rockfish was above 80\% across all capture depths, while survival of canary rockfish was lower, declining sharply to just 25\% at capture depths greater than 135m. Fish of both species that were alive after 48h of caging displayed very few of the external signs of pronounced barotrauma and had a high submergence success rate when released at the surface. Logistic regression analysis, using a combined data set from this and an earlier experiment conducted at shallower capture depths, was used to more broadly evaluate factors influencing post-recompression survival. For canary rockfish, depth of capture was negatively related to survival (P{$<$}0.0001), but the surface-bottom temperature differential was not (P{$>$}0.05). Exophthalmia and ocular emphysema were each negatively associated with survival for canary rockfish (P{$<$}0.05). For yelloweye rockfish, no significant associations were found between post-recompression survival and capture depth, the surface-bottom temperature differential or any of the signs of pronounced barotrauma (P{$>$}0.05).},

In agricultural streams of the Midwestern US, floodplain restoration has the potential to enhance inorganic nitrogen (N) removal by increasing the bioreactive surface area for microbially-mediated denitrification. The restoration of inset floodplains via construction of the two-stage ditch increases denitrification compared to channelized systems, however, little is known about how denitrification on restored floodplains compares to those formed naturally when stream channel management lapses. We used sacrificial microcosm incubations and membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) to compare denitrification rates in floodplain soils collected along transects in both naturalized and restored floodplains; longitudinal transects spanned two zones in the active floodplain (near-stream, NS vs. middle, MID) and a third zone that reflected upland conditions in the riparian buffer strip (UP). Denitrification rates were 35–49\% higher in the restored, inset floodplains compared to naturalized floodplains. Variation in denitrification rates were primarily explained by soil organic matter (OM) and OM was~{$>~$}20\% higher in restored floodplains than naturalized, highlighting the contrasts between stable, constructed floodplains with heterogeneous, depositional bars typical of naturalizing channels. Consequently, restored inset floodplains could remove~{$>~$}70\% more N than the naturalized floodplains during similar storm inundation events.},

We used nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) to measure 15N2 uptake into UCYN-A/haptophyte symbiosis and found that UCYN-A strains identical to low-latitude strains are fixing N2 in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, at rates comparable to subtropical waters. These results show definitively that cyanobacterial N2 fixation is not constrained to subtropical waters, challenging paradigms and models of global N2 fixation. The Arctic is particularly sensitive to climate change, and N2 fixation may increase in Arctic waters under future climate scenarios.},

  abstract = {It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976–77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10–15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965–1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone. © 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Point sampling of soft sediment macrofauna was conducted across the shelf and upper slope in the northeastern Pacific Ocean off the United States Pacific Northwest coast to conduct a regional analysis of species composition and use species assemblages to define habitat types. Analyses focused on linking spatial variability in macrofauna assemblages with measured environmental parameters using nMDS plots and the LINKTREE routine in Primer. Depth was the primary structuring variable (i.e., macrofauna species assemblages first separated by depth) with sediment parameters (percent fines, grain size, and total organic carbon) secondary and nearly as statistically important. A depth break of \textasciitilde 90~m was the environmental variable that correlated with the greatest separation among our stations based on differences in macrofaunal assemblages, which is not a classically described depth break for shelf macrofauna. The next largest changes in assemblage composition were at 43~m and 200~m. Within each of these depth zones on the shelf, we detected significant differences in assemblages related to different sediment grain sizes. Below the 200~m break – a depth traditionally delineating the continental shelf and slope – subsequent changes in assemblage composition were detected at 221~m and 445~m depth breaks; further delineations in assemblages related to sediment parameters were not detected. Knowing how macrofaunal communities vary with grain size and depth can inform future site surveys, develop tools for mapping macrofauna habitat suitability based primarily on these physical factors, and develop hypotheses of how benthic communities might be affected by offshore projects.},

  abstract = {A set of spatially nested circulation models is used to explore interannual change in the northeast Pacific (NEP) during 1997–2002, and remote vs. local influence of the 1997–1998 El Niño on this region. Our nested set is based on the primitive equations of motion, and includes a basin-scale model of the north Pacific at ∼40-km resolution (NPac), and a regional model of the Northeast Pacific at ∼10-km resolution. The NEP model spans an area from Baja California through the Bering Sea, from the coast to ∼2000-km offshore. In this context, “remote influence” refers to effects driven by changes in ocean velocity and temperature outside of the NEP domain; “local influence” refers to direct forcing by winds and runoff within the NEP domain. A base run of this model using hindcast winds and runoff for 1996–2002 replicates the dominant spatial modes of sea-surface height anomalies from satellite data, and coastal sea level from tide gauges. We have performed a series of sensitivity runs with the NEP model for 1997–1998, which analyze the response of coastal sea level to: (1) hindcast winds and coastal runoff, as compared to their monthly climatologies and (2) hindcast boundary conditions (from the NPac model), as compared to their monthly climatologies. Results indicate penetration of sea-surface height (SSH) from the basin-scale model into the NEP domain (e.g., remote influence), with propagation as coastal trapped waves from Baja up through Alaska. Most of the coastal sea-level anomaly off Alaska in El Niño years appears due to direct forcing by local winds and runoff (local influence), and such anomalies are much stronger than those produced off California. We quantify these effects as a function of distance along the coastline, and consider how they might impact the coastal ecosystems of the NEP.},

Here, we collate all available data for experimental and comparative studies of trawling impacts on whole communities of seabed macroinvertebrates on sedimentary habitats and develop widely applicable methods to estimate depletion and recovery rates of biota after trawling. Depletion of biota and trawl penetration into the seabed are highly correlated. Otter trawls caused the least depletion, removing 6\% of biota per pass and penetrating the seabed on average down to 2.4 cm, whereas hydraulic dredges caused the most depletion, removing 41\% of biota and penetrating the seabed on average 16.1 cm. Median recovery times posttrawling (from 50 to 95\% of unimpacted biomass) ranged between 1.9 and 6.4 y. By accounting for the effects of penetration depth, environmental variation, and uncertainty, the models explained much of the variability of depletion and recovery estimates from single studies. Coupled with large-scale, high-resolution maps of trawling frequency and habitat, our estimates of depletion and recovery rates enable the assessment of trawling impacts on unprecedented spatial scales.},

One group represented largely by academic marine ecologists sees almost universal failure of fisheries management and calls for the use of marine-protected areas as the central tool of a new approach to rebuilding the marine ecosystems of the world. The scientists working in fisheries agencies and many academic scientists see a more complex picture, with many failed fisheries but also numerous successes. This group argues that we need to apply the lessons from the successful fisheries to stop the decline and rebuild those fisheries threatened by excess fishing. These lessons are stopping the competitive race to fish by appropriate incentives for fishing fleets and good governance. The major tool of resetting incentives is granting various forms of dedicated access, including community-based fishing rights, allocation to cooperatives, and individual fishing quotas. Many of the failed fisheries of the world occur in jurisdictions where central governments are not functional, and local control of fisheries is an essential part of the solution.},

In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species-abundance curve.

  abstract = {Biophysical individual-based models (IBMs) have been used to study aspects of early life history of marine fishes such as recruitment, connectivity of spawning and nursery areas, and marine reserve design. However, there is no consistent approach to validating the spatial outputs of these models. In this study, we hope to rectify this gap. We document additions to an existing individual-based biophysical model for Alaska walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), some simulations made with this model and methods that were used to describe and compare spatial output of the model versus field data derived from ichthyoplankton surveys in the Gulf of Alaska. We used visual methods (e.g. distributional centroids with directional ellipses), several indices (such as a Normalized Difference Index (NDI), and an Overlap Coefficient (OC), and several statistical methods: the Syrjala method, the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, and a geostatistical method for comparing spatial indices. We assess the utility of these different methods in analyzing spatial output and comparing model output to data, and give recommendations for their appropriate use. Visual methods are useful for initial comparisons of model and data distributions. Metrics such as the NDI and OC give useful measures of co-location and overlap, but care must be taken in discretizing the fields into bins. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic is useful to determine the patchiness of the fields. The Syrjala method is an easily implemented statistical measure of the difference between the fields, but does not give information on the details of the distributions. Finally, the geostatistical comparison of spatial indices gives good information of details of the distributions and whether they differ significantly between the model and the data. We conclude that each technique gives quite different information about the model-data distribution comparison, and that some are easy to apply and some more complex. We also give recommendations for a multistep process to validate spatial output from IBMs.},

Using a manned submersible, we ran visual transects at Coquille Bank, 25~km off the central coast of Oregon, USA, including six half-hour (mean length 1184~m) transects over mud seafloors 183–361~m deep. The shallowest transects were untrawled, whereas deeper transects were heavily trawled, as evidenced by extensive trawl-door tracks. Differences between trawled and untrawled seafloor assemblages were striking. We observed 23\% more fish over untrawled compared to trawled seafloors, and recorded 27 fish species on untrawled bottoms, but only 19 species on trawled seafloors. Regarding benthic invertebrates, density of individuals was 6 times greater on untrawled compared to trawled bottoms. Nonetheless, we observed 11 taxa on trawled seafloors and only 6 taxa on untrawled bottoms. Principal components analysis (PCA) defined the untrawled assemblage as characterized by sea pens, ratfish, sablefish, ronquil, slender sole, and poacher. PCA defined the trawled assemblage as characterized by seastars, hermit crabs, bigfin eelpout, Dover sole, hagfish, and shortspine thornyhead. In untrawled areas, there was no correlation between sea-pen density and total fish density, whereas in trawled areas, there was a marginally inverse correlation between the density of trawl-door tracks and total fish density. The dominant fishes and macroinvertebrates on trawled seafloors are known mobile scavengers that may aggregate along trawl-door tracks. Sea pens that dominated untrawled bottoms are sessile, slow-growing, long-lived species that are likely to recover slowly from physical disturbance. We conclude that the observed differences between trawled and untrawled communities were the result of groundfishing activities rather than local environmental differences. Given that habitat considerations for groundfish management in this region focus exclusively on rocky seafloors, it seems prudent to consider the adverse effects of bottom trawling on mud seafloor ecosystems of the continental shelf and slope.},

The results clearly reveal a quadratic relationship between wind speed and gas transfer velocity rather than a recently proposed cubic relationship. A new parameterization between wind speed and gas transfer velocity is proposed, which is consistent with previous 3He/SF6 dual tracer results from the coastal and open ocean obtained at lower wind speeds. This suggests that factors controlling air-sea gas exchange in this region are similar to those in other parts of the world ocean, and that the parameterization presented here should be applicable to the global ocean.},

  abstract = {Changes in the climate due to anthropogenic effects are impacting the global oceans and the constituent biology, particularly through changes in water temperature. Impacts of warming water on oceanic species are most likely to be detected as changes in distribution. Pelagic fishes, in particular, respond to changes in ocean temperature, and modify their distribution on seasonal and interannual timescales, and thus are likely to do so in the future. Global climate models provide insight into possible future conditions, but there is also considerable uncertainty regarding future changes because of differences in model structure and future scenarios. To address some of this uncertainty, I considered output from multiple climate models through an ensemble analysis and examined potential changes in the distribution of large pelagic fishes captured by longline fisheries on the east and west coast of Australia by the year 2100. For the east coast, over 95\% of model predictions for 14 pelagic species (tunas and billfishes) suggested that core range would move south, and be smaller than what occurs presently. There was less certainty for the west coast, although the core range for all 14 species moved south and was smaller for 63\% and larger for 37\% of scenario-model combinations. The overall rate of predicted habitat movement for the suite of pelagic species averaged about 40km/decade. While relatively coarse, these predictions give some confidence to stakeholders about likely changes in future distribution for these regionally important pelagic fishes.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is affecting the environment of all oceans, modifying ocean circulation, temperature, chemistry and productivity. While evidence for changes in physical signals is often distinct, impacts on fishes inhabiting oceanic systems are not easily identified, and therefore, quantification of responses is less common. Correctly attributing changes associated with a changing climate from other drivers is important for the implementation of effective harvest and management strategies and for addressing associated socio-economic impacts, particularly for countries highly dependent on oceanic resources. Data supporting investigation of responses of oceanic species to climate impacts include fisheries catch, fisheries-independent surveys, and conventional and electronic tagging data. However, there are a number of challenges associated with detecting climatic responses with these data, including (i) data collection costs (ii) small sample sizes (iii) limited time series relative to temporal scales at which environmental variability occurs, (iv) changing fisher and fisheries behavior due to non-climate drivers and (v) changes in population dynamics due to natural climate variability and non-climate drivers. We highlight potential biases and suggest strategies that should be considered when using oceanic fish and fisheries data in the evaluation of climate change impacts. Consideration of these factors is important when assessing variability in exploited species and designing management responses to climate or fisheries threats.},

  abstract = {The California Current Ecosystem has experienced variable climate regimes, hypoxia, and marine heatwave events that have the potential to impact groundfishes and their associated fisheries. Using bottom trawl survey data collected by NOAA Fisheries, we assessed changes over the last four decades in northern California Current continental shelf (≤200 m) groundfish assemblage composition, species' presence, and relationships to environmental and habitat variables. We focus on the currently understudied continental shelf area, due to its ecological and economic importance, especially after the recent opening of historically important areas to trawling. We found a temporally consistent separation in groundfish assemblages between depth zones based on NMS analysis using species found in over 1\% of samples, with shallow, mid-, and deep shelf groupings. Grain size, species richness, and diversity were associated with assemblage composition. Then, focusing on petrale sole, rex sole, lingcod, arrowtooth flounder, sablefish, English sole, Pacific sanddab, and Dover sole, we examined what factors impact groundfish presence and abundance on the shelf. Bottom temperature, sediment characteristics, and depth were correlated with abundance for all species. These results corroborate previous work indicating recent reductions in presence of hypoxia-intolerant species. Shallow-water groundfishes known to tolerate warmer water and low dissolved oxygen concentrations exhibit reductions offshore, possibly a result of low recruitment. There have been significant spatiotemporal changes in the shelf groundfish populations over the past several decades, and while assemblage composition over most of the shelf remains consistent, single species distributional shifts may impact access to target species in newly reopened areas.},

  abstract = {We propose a new hypothesis, the Oscillating Control Hypothesis (OCH), which predicts that pelagic ecosystem function in the southeastern Bering Sea will alternate between primarily bottom-up control in cold regimes and primarily top-down control in warm regimes. The timing of spring primary production is determined predominately by the timing of ice retreat. Late ice retreat (late March or later) leads to an early, ice-associated bloom in cold water (e.g., 1995, 1997, 1999), whereas no ice, or early ice retreat before mid-March, leads to an open-water bloom in May or June in warm water (e.g., 1996, 1998, 2000). Zooplankton populations are not closely coupled to the spring bloom, but are sensitive to water temperature. In years when the spring bloom occurs in cold water, low temperatures limit the production of zooplankton, the survival of larval/juvenile fish, and their recruitment into the populations of species of large piscivorous fish, such as walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias). When continued over decadal scales, this will lead to bottom-up limitation and a decreased biomass of piscivorous fish. Alternatively, in periods when the bloom occurs in warm water, zooplankton populations should grow rapidly, providing plentiful prey for larval and juvenile fish. Abundant zooplankton will support strong recruitment of fish and will lead to abundant predatory fish that control forage fish, including, in the case of pollock, their own juveniles. Piscivorous marine birds and pinnipeds may achieve higher production of young and survival in cold regimes, when there is less competition from large piscivorous fish for cold-water forage fish such as capelin (Mallotus villosus). Piscivorous seabirds and pinnipeds also may be expected to have high productivity in periods of transition from cold regimes to warm regimes, when young of large predatory species of fish are numerous enough to provide forage. The OCH predicts that the ability of large predatory fish populations to sustain fishing pressure will vary between warm and cold regimes. The OCH points to the importance of the timing of ice retreat and water temperatures during the spring bloom for the productivity of zooplankton, and the degree and direction of coupling between zooplankton and forage fish. Forage fish (e.g., juvenile pollock, capelin, Pacific herring [Clupea pallasii]) are key prey for adult pollock and other apex predators. In the southeastern Bering Sea, important changes in the biota since the mid-1970s include a marked increase in the biomass of large piscivorous fish and a concurrent decline in the biomass of forage fish, including age-1 walleye pollock, particularly over the southern portion of the shelf. Populations of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and seabirds such as kittiwakes (Rissa spp.) at the Pribilof Islands have declined, most probably in response to a diminished prey base. The available evidence suggests that these changes are unlikely the result of a decrease in total annual new primary production, though the possibility of reduced post-bloom production during summer remains. An ecosystem approach to management of the Bering Sea and its fisheries is of great importance if all of the ecosystem components valued by society are to thrive. Cognizance of how climate regimes may alter relationships within this ecosystem will facilitate reaching that goal.},

  abstract = {For the first four billion years of~Earth’s history, climate was marked by apparent stability and warmth despite the Sun having lower luminosity1. Proposed mechanisms for maintaining an elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (\$\$\{p\}\_\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{CO\}\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash rm\{2\}\}\}\}\$\$) centre on a reduction in the weatherability of Earth’s crust and therefore in the efficiency of carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere2. However, the effectiveness of these mechanisms remains debated2,3. Here we use a global carbon cycle model to explore the evolution of processes that govern marine pH, a factor that regulates the partitioning of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere. We find that elevated rates of ‘reverse weathering’—that is, the consumption of alkalinity and generation of acidity during marine authigenic clay formation4–7—enhanced the retention of carbon within the ocean–atmosphere system, leading to an elevated \$\$\{p\}\_\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{CO\}\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash rm\{2\}\}\}\}\$\$baseline. Although this process is dampened by sluggish kinetics today, we propose that more prolific rates of reverse weathering would have persisted under the pervasively silica-rich conditions8,9 that dominated Earth’s early oceans. This distinct ocean and coupled carbon–silicon cycle state would have successfully maintained the equable and ice-free environment that characterized most of the Precambrian period. Further, we propose that during this time, the establishment of a strong negative feedback between marine pH and authigenic clay formation would have also enhanced climate stability by mitigating large swings in \$\$\{p\}\_\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{CO\}\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash rm\{2\}\}\}\}\$\$—a critical component of Earth’s natural thermostat that would have been dominant for most of Earth’s history. We speculate that the late ecological rise of siliceous organisms8 and a resulting decline in silica-rich conditions dampened the reverse weathering buffer, destabilizing Earth’s climate system and lowering baseline \$\$\{p\}\_\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{CO\}\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash rm\{2\}\}\}\}\$\$.},

  abstract = {Using a hierarchy of models, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding the physical processes controlling the magnitude and patterns of the saturation state of dissolved argon (δAr) in the ocean. A conceptual box model of the argon cycle demonstrates that the saturation state of argon in the thermocline can be considered a linear combination of a preformed disequilibrium (δArpre) governed by surface processes and mapped into the ocean interior, and a supersaturation driven by diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean (δArmix). The magnitude of δArmix is determined by the relative strength of isopycnal ventilation and diapycnal mixing in the thermocline. We extend the simple theory to a three-dimensional, continuously stratified ocean by deriving a mathematical relationship between diapycnal mixing, air-sea heat fluxes and the saturation state of argon. This relationship predicts that the δAr of a water parcel increases following its flow path at a rate that is proportional to the diapycnal diffusivity (κ). The theoretical predictions are evaluated with a numerical ocean basin model showing reasonable agreement between simulated argon distribution and the theory. We find three distinctive regimes in which different dynamical balances determine the saturation state of argon in the thermocline. First, newly ventilated water in the subtropical gyre is dominated by δArpre, reflecting the balance between air-sea heat transfer and the gas exchange rates. Second, the saturation state of argon in the tropical thermocline is primarily determined by δArmix, reflecting the important roles of diapycnal mixing there. Third, at the transition between the ventilated gyre and the poorly ventilated tropics, δArpre and δArmix together control the saturation state of argon. In this region, δAr is sensitive to model diffusivity, which can be estimated from the simulated distribution of δAr with an error of less than 50\%. Thus noble gas concentrations may provide a unique constraint on the basin-scale diapycnal diffusivity of the subtropical thermocline.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Recent observations have shown that fluxes of ballast minerals (calcium carbonate, opal, and lithogenic material) and organic carbon fluxes are closely correlated in the bathypelagic zones of the ocean. Hence it has been hypothesized that incorporation of biogenic minerals within marine aggregates could either protect the organic matter from decomposition and/or increase the sinking velocity via ballasting of the aggregates. Here we present the first combined data on size, sinking velocity, carbon-specific respiration rate, and composition measured directly in three aggregate types; Emiliania huxleyi aggregates (carbonate ballasted), Skeletonema costatum aggregates (opal ballasted), and aggregates made from a mix of both E. huxleyi and S. costatum (carbonate and opal ballasted). Overall average carbon-specific respiration rate was \textasciitilde 0.13 d−1 and did not vary with aggregate type and size. Ballasting from carbonate resulted in 2- to 2.5-fold higher sinking velocities than those of aggregates ballasted by opal. We compiled literature data on carbon-specific respiration rate and sinking velocity measured in aggregates of different composition and sources. Compiled carbon-specific respiration rates (including this study) vary between 0.08 d−1 and 0.20 d−1. Sinking velocity increases with increasing aggregate size within homogeneous sources of aggregates. When compared across different particle and aggregate sources, however, sinking velocity appeared to be independent of particle or aggregate size. The carbon-specific respiration rate per meter settled varied between 0.0002 m−1 and 0.0030 m−1, and decreased with increasing aggregate size. It was lower for calcite ballasted aggregates as compared to that of similar sized opal ballasted aggregates.},

  abstract = {The impacts of a hypothetical slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are assessed in a state-of-the-art global climate model (HadGEM3), with particular emphasis on Europe. This is the highest resolution coupled global climate model to be used to study the impacts of an AMOC slowdown so far. Many results found are consistent with previous studies and can be considered robust impacts from a large reduction or collapse of the AMOC. These include: widespread cooling throughout the North Atlantic and northern hemisphere in general; less precipitation in the northern hemisphere midlatitudes; large changes in precipitation in the tropics and a strengthening of the North Atlantic storm track. The focus on Europe, aided by the increase in resolution, has revealed previously undiscussed impacts, particularly those associated with changing atmospheric circulation patterns. Summer precipitation decreases (increases) in northern (southern) Europe and is associated with a negative summer North Atlantic Oscillation signal. Winter precipitation is also affected by the changing atmospheric circulation, with localised increases in precipitation associated with more winter storms and a strengthened winter storm track. Stronger westerly winds in winter increase the warming maritime effect while weaker westerlies in summer decrease the cooling maritime effect. In the absence of these circulation changes the cooling over Europe’s landmass would be even larger in both seasons. The general cooling and atmospheric circulation changes result in weaker peak river flows and vegetation productivity, which may raise issues of water availability and crop production.},

  abstract = {Bathymetry is a key element in the demography of Dover sole Microstomus pacificus. Juvenile Dover soles begin life in relatively shallow water on the continental shelf but move gradually down the continental slope into deeper water as they grow and reach sexual maturity. Large and old individuals may eventually reach depths greater than 1,500 m. The ontogenetic migration of Dover soles into deeper water gives rise to a general pattern of increasing fish size with water depth, but there are differences between sexes and locations. To describe these patterns in greater detail, we computed probability distributions for depth, length, and sex using research trawl data for Dover sole taken off central California and Oregon. Our results indicate that females live at greater depths than do males and that abundance of large Dover soles may be lower at depths where lowest oxygen concentrations occur. In addition, major differences in bathymetric demography exist between study sites due, we suggest, to differences in bottom topography. We used one group of probability distributions and logbook data for Oregon and central California in a simple model to demonstrate how depth of fishing and bathymetric demography complicate interpretation of length composition and other data from a commercial fishery. Results from the model indicate that depth-stratified assessment models may be required to interpret fisheries data for Dover sole and other species, like shortspine thornyhead Sebastolobus alascanus and sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria that undergo ontogenetic migration from shallow into deep water.},

We examined upwelling directly from the vertical velocity field, which elucidates important temporal and spatial variability not captured by traditional coastal upwelling indices. Through much of the CCS, upwelling within 50 km of the coast has increased, as reported elsewhere. However, from 50 to 200 km offshore, upwelling trends are negative and interannual variability is 180◦ out of phase with the nearshore signal. This cross-shore pattern shows up as the primary mode of variability in central and northern CCS vertical velocity anomalies, accounting for ∼40\% of the total variance. Corresponding time series of the dominant modes in the central and northern CCS are strongly correlated with large-scale climate indices, suggesting that climate fluctuations may alternately favor different biological communities.},

  abstract = {In Eastern Boundary Current systems, wind-driven upwelling drives nutrient-rich water to the ocean surface, making these regions among the most productive on Earth. Regulation of productivity by changing wind and/or nutrient conditions can dramatically impact ecosystem functioning, though the mechanisms are not well understood beyond broad-scale relationships. Here, we explore bottom-up controls during the California Current System (CCS) upwelling season by quantifying the dependence of phytoplankton biomass (as indicated by satellite chlorophyll estimates) on two key environmental parameters: subsurface nitrate concentration and surface wind stress. In general, moderate winds and high nitrate concentrations yield maximal biomass near shore, while offshore biomass is positively correlated with subsurface nitrate concentration. However, due to nonlinear interactions between the influences of wind and nitrate, bottom-up control of phytoplankton cannot be described by either one alone, nor by a combined metric such as nitrate flux. We quantify optimal environmental conditions for phytoplankton, defined as the wind/nitrate space that maximizes chlorophyll concentration and present a framework for evaluating ecosystem change relative to environmental drivers. The utility of this framework is demonstrated by (i) elucidating anomalous CCS responses in 1998–1999, 2002 and 2005 and (ii) providing a basis for assessing potential biological impacts of projected climate change.},

  abstract = {Coastal upwelling is responsible for thriving marine ecosystems and fisheries that are disproportionately productive relative to their surface area, particularly in the world's major eastern boundary upwelling systems. Along oceanic eastern boundaries, equatorward wind stress and the Earth's rotation combine to drive a near-surface layer of water offshore, a process called Ekman transport. Similarly, positive wind stress curl drives divergence in the surface Ekman layer and consequently upwelling from below, a process known as Ekman suction. In both cases, displaced water is replaced by upwelling of relatively nutrient-rich water from below, which stimulates the growth of microscopic phytoplankton that form the base of the marine food web. Ekman theory is foundational and underlies the calculation of upwelling indices such as the “Bakun Index” that are ubiquitous in eastern boundary upwelling system studies. While generally valuable first-order descriptions, these indices and their underlying theory provide an incomplete picture of coastal upwelling. Here we review the relevant dynamics and limitations of classical upwelling indices, particularly related to representation of the surface wind stress, the influence of geostrophic currents, and the properties of upwelled water. To address these shortcomings, we present two new upwelling indices for the U.S. West Coast (31–47°N), which are available from 1988 to present. The Coastal Upwelling Transport Index and the Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index provide improved estimates of vertical transport and vertical nitrate flux, respectively, by leveraging technological and scientific advances realized since the introduction of the Bakun Index nearly a half century ago.},

  abstract = {The magnitude and distribution of the particulate organic carbon (POC) rain rate to the seafloor in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean basins between 61°N and 61°S has been estimated from benthic oxygen flux estimates (for water depths ≥ 1000 m only). The calculation utilizes the extensive data sets of sedimentary organic carbon, CaCO3, and accumulation rate to extrapolate between individual benthic flux measurement sites using an empirically-derived correlation between the seafloor oxygen flux and these parameters. The POC flux through the 1000 m depth horizon was then estimated from published correlations between sediment trap-determined fluxes and water depth. Total oxygen utilization in the deep ocean is estimated to be 1.2×1014 mol O2 yr−1, a value that agrees well with previous estimates which were based on surface water primary productivity, sediment trap, and depth relationships and with deep water respiration rates estimated from apparant oxygen utilization (AOU)-14C relationships. On the basis of the derived global ocean flux distribution, it is concluded that (1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) inputs are not required to account for estimated deep water respiration rates; (2) the majority of the POC input to the deep ocean occurs within 30° of the equator; (3) the proportion of primary production that reaches the deep sea does not vary greatly with latitude; (4) gyre and continental margin regions contribute roughly equally to the deep POC flux with a relatively minor contribution from the equatorial divergence region; (5) of the estimated 7.2×1013 mol C yr−1 of POC that sinks below the 1000 m depth horizon, 45\% (3.3×1013 mol C yr−1) reaches the seafloor where it is oxidized; (6) when normalized to basin area, average deep flux rates in the Atlantic and Pacific are similar while highest rates are observed in the Indian Ocean; and (7) the results can be fully reconciled only if the benthic flux of DOC is significantly less than the benthic O2 flux.},

This is of conservation and management concern since skates exhibit a broad range of life history characteristics. The present study investigated the age and growth of the Starry Skate, Raja stellulata, and compared it to other regional skates inhabiting the U.S. West Coast. Age and growth parameters were determined using two vertebral preparation techniques: gross sectioning and histological sectioning. Gross section age estimates ranged from zero to 11~years and growth was described by the two parameter von Bertalanffy growth function (2 VBGF; L∞\,=\,915~mm total length (TL) and k\,=\,0.13~year-1; n\,=\,189). Histological section age estimates ranged from zero to 15~years and growth was also described by the 2 VBGF (L∞\,=\,1092~mm TL, k\,=\,0.06~year-1; n\,=\,68). Histological section results reflect a more conservative life history, specifically a lower von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, but had slightly biased results and a smaller sample size than the gross section results. An age and depth trend was found within the central California skate assemblage, in which habitat depth and maximum age were positively correlated.},

We identify and discuss advantages and challenges of ensemble modelling approaches in the context of scientific advice. There are uncertainties associated with every phase in the stock assessment process: data collection, assessment model choice, model assumptions, interpretation of risk, up to the implementation of management advice. Additionally, the dynamics of fish populations are complex, and our incomplete understanding of those dynamics and limited observations of important mechanisms, necessitate that models are simpler than nature. The aim is for the model to capture enough of the dynamics to accurately estimate trends and abundance, and provide the basis for robust advice about sustainable harvests. The status quo approach to assessment modelling has been to identify the “best” model and generate advice from that model, mostly ignoring advice from other model configurations regardless of how closely they performed relative to the chosen model. We discuss and make suggestions about the utility of ensemble models, including revisions to the formal process of providing advice to management bodies, and recommend further research to evaluate potential gains in modelling and advice performance.},

The assemblages accounted for about 70\% of the total variation in species composition among 2565 hauls. Although the assemblages persisted over the 15-year study period and occurred within broad geographic boundaries, some had substantially different spatial distributions among surveys. The ability to differentiate assemblages across five environmental variables (latitude, depth, surface and bottom water temperatures, and surficial substrate) was low. The preponderance of hake-dominated assemblages throughout the study area suggests that Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) may play a large role in the dynamics of demersal fish communities off the west coast of the United States.},

  abstract = {Abstract The marine heatwave of 2014/2015 in the Northeast Pacific caused significant impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries. While several studies suggest that land and marine heatwaves may intensify under climate change, less is known about the prolonged multiyear nature (\textasciitilde 2~years) of the Northeast Pacific events. Examination of reanalysis products and a 30-member climate model ensemble confirms that prolonged multiyear marine heatwaves are linked to the dynamics of the two dominant modes of winter sea surface temperature variability in the North Pacific, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). Specifically, we find a significant correlation between winter warm NPGO anomalies and the following winter PDO arising from extratropical/tropical teleconnections. In the model projections for 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario, this NPGO/PDO 1~year lag correlation exhibits a significant positive trend (\textasciitilde 35\%) that favors more prolonged multiyear warm events ({$>$}1°C) with larger spatial coverage (\textasciitilde 18\%) and higher maximum amplitude (\textasciitilde 0.5°C for events {$>$}2°C) over the Northeast Pacific.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-based management places a strong emphasis on habitat, but little work has been done to examine how water column properties may influence the distribution, abundances and structure of groundfish assemblages. We identified and described oceanographic habitats in the northern California Current based on temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a and the inherent variability in these factors. We then examined the distribution and the abundance of groundfishes in relation to these oceanographic habitats and conditions with the long-term goal of improving science for ecosystem-based management of the groundfish fishery of the west coast of the USA. Five summertime oceanographic habitats with distinct physical and biological characteristics were identified in the northeast Pacific Ocean off the northwest Coast of the USA: Offshore Habitat, Upwelling Habitat, Highly Variable Upwelling Habitat, River Plume Habitat, and Highly Variable Habitat. Overall, the species composition differed among the five oceanographic habitats, with certain groundfish species being highly indicative of some habitats; however, the majority of the associations were weak due to overlap of species distributions in the nearshore oceanographic habitats. In contrast, groundfish species showed strong associations with individual oceanographic factors, primarily depth, surface chlorophyll-a, and bottom salinity and temperature. In addition, latitudinal variations in upwelling intensity, river discharge and productivity led to the identification of three regions where high chlorophyll-a concentrations were associated with large abundances of specific groundfish species. The combined oceanographic datasets and data products that we produced have the potential to be a powerful tool for improving our knowledge of the west coast ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The net balance between photosynthesis and respiration in the surface ocean is a key regulator of ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) partitioning, and by extension, Earth's climate. The slight excess of photosynthesis over community respiration in sunlit waters, known as net community production (NCP), sets the upper bound on the sequestration of carbon via biologically mediated export. Prevailing paradigms suggest a high/low binary where net primary production (NPP), NCP, and export are highest in ecosystems characterized by microplankton ({$>$}20 μm) and lowest in ecosystems dominated by picoplankton ({$<$}2 μm). This bifurcation model neglects the potential importance of nanoplankton (2–20 μm)—i.e., the “middle” size class—toward global biological pump functioning. Here, we show a relationship between the biomass of nanoplankton and oxygen-based estimates of NCP across natural ecological gradients in the North Pacific Ocean. Using a suite of high-resolution optical imaging approaches including SeaFlow, Imaging FlowCytobot, and laser-based scattering, nanoplankton dynamics are observed to dominate the particle size distribution throughout an 1,000 km transition between the subtropical and subpolar North Pacific, where NCP rates are threefold to fivefold higher than subtropical values. Based on ecological theory applied to the Darwin size-based ecosystem model, we hypothesize that intermediate size class organisms are capable of high rates of production via an optimization of bottom-up and top-down control inherent to the “middle class.” More broadly, the model indicates the global importance of nanoplankton for ocean biological production.},

  abstract = {Catches and prices from many fisheries exhibit high interannual variability, leading to variability in the income derived by fishery participants. The economic risk posed by this may be mitigated in some cases if individuals participate in several different fisheries, particularly if revenues from those fisheries are uncorrelated or vary asynchronously. We construct indices of gross income diversification from fisheries at the level of individual vessels and find that the income of the current fleet of vessels on the US West Coast and in Alaska is less diverse than at any point in the past 30 y. We also find a dome-shaped relationship between the variability of individuals' income and income diversification, which implies that a small amount of diversification does not reduce income risk but that higher levels of diversification can substantially reduce the variability of income from fishing. Moving from a single fishery strategy to a 50-25-25 split in revenues reduces the expected coefficient of variation of gross revenues between 24\% and 65\% for the vessels included in this study. The increasing access restrictions in many marine fisheries through license reductions and moratoriums have the potential to limit fishermen's ability to diversify their income risk across multiple fisheries. Catch share programs often result in consolidation initially and may reduce diversification. However, catch share programs also make it feasible for fishermen to build a portfolio of harvest privileges and potentially reduce their income risk. Therefore, catch share programs create both threats and opportunities for fishermen wishing to maintain diversified fishing strategies.},

Marine pelagic ecosystems are likewise changing in response to warming, changing chemistry, and resource exploitation. However, unlike spatial landscapes that migrate slowly with time, pelagic seascapes are embedded in a turbulent, advective ocean. Adaptations from landscape ecology to marine pelagic ecosystem management must consider the nature and scale of biophysical interactions associated with organisms ranging from microbes to whales, a hierarchical organization shaped by physical processes, and our limited capacity to observe and monitor these phenomena across global oceans. High frequency, multiscale, and synoptic characterization of the 4-D variability of seascapes are now available through improved classification methods, a maturing array of satellite remote sensing products, advances in autonomous sampling of multiple levels of biological complexity, and emergence of observational networks. Merging of oceanographic and ecological paradigms will be necessary to observe, manage, and conserve species embedded in a dynamic seascape mosaic, where the boundaries, extent, and location of features change with time.},

  abstract = {A temporally and spatially variable Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) was established as a marine protected area along the US west coast in 2002 to protect stocks of rockfishes Sebastes spp. Since the RCA falls within the region sampled annually by the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey, we utilized data collected from 2003 to 2011 to evaluate whether establishment of the RCA influenced catch per unit effort (CPUE), species richness, and size distribution of demersal fishes. We compared CPUE and species richness among 3 management areas (continuously closed, periodically closed, and open to commercial bottom trawling) using analysis of covariance models that account for variability due to area, year, and depth. The most appropriate models for CPUE (35 species treated individually and aggregated into 6 subgroups) and species richness were selected using Akaike’s information criterion. All of the best-fit models were highly significant (p {$<$} 0.0001), explaining 3 to 76\% of the variation in catch. For 27 species and 5 subgroups, mean CPUE was significantly greater within the area continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling relative to areas periodically closed or open. The most appropriate model for richness included area and year, and mean richness was greatest in the area continuously closed to trawling. Species-specific length composition distributions were calculated from subsampled individual lengths for 31 species. Significant differences in length frequency distributions were observed, with a higher proportion (\textasciitilde 65\%) of larger fish most often present in areas continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling (20 of 31 species) relative to other areas. Our data suggest that the RCA is an effective management tool for conserving not only rockfishes, but also other demersal fish species.},

  abstract = {Long-term environmental sampling provided information on catch and near-bottom oxygen levels across a range of depths and conditions from the upper to the lower limit of the oxygen minimum zone and shoreward across the continental shelf of the US west coast (US−Canada to US−Mexico). During 2008 to 2014, near-bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 5.5 ml l−1 with 63.2\% of sites experiencing hypoxia (DO {$<$} 1.43 ml l−1). The relationship between catch per unit effort (CPUE) and DO was estimated for 34 demersal fish species in 5 subgroups by life history category (roundfishes, flatfishes, shelf rockfishes, slope rockfishes and thornyheads) using generalized additive models (GAMs). Models included terms for position, time, near-bottom environmental measurements (salinity, temperature, oxygen) and bottom depth. Significant positive relationships between CPUE and DO occurred for 19 of 34 groundfish species within hypoxic bottom waters. Community effects (total CPUE and species richness for demersal fishes) also exhibited significant and positive relationships with low near-bottom oxygen levels. GAM analysis revealed an apparent threshold effect at lower oxygen levels, where small changes in oxygen produced large changes in catch for several species, as well as total catch and species richness. An additional 7 species displayed negative trends. Based on Akaike’s information criterion values, near-bottom oxygen played a major role in the distribution of flatfishes, roundfishes and thornyheads. By examining similarities and differences in the response of various subgroups of commercially important groundfish species to low DO levels, we uncovered ecological inferences of potential value to future ecosystem-based management.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent advances in the application of stock identification methods have revealed inconsistencies between the spatial structure of biological populations and the definition of stock units used in assessment and management. From a fisheries management perspective, stocks are typically assumed to be discrete units with homogeneous vital rates that can be exploited independently of each other. However, the unit stock assumption is often violated leading to spatial mismatches that can bias stock assessment and impede sustainable fisheries management. The primary ecological concern is the potential for overexploitation of unique spawning components, which can lead to loss of productivity and reduced biodiversity along with destabilization of local and regional stock dynamics. Furthermore, ignoring complex population structure and stock connectivity can lead to misperception of the magnitude of fish productivity, which can translate to suboptimal utilization of the resource. We describe approaches that are currently being applied to improve the assessment and management process for marine fish in situations where complex spatial structure has led to an observed mismatch between the scale of biological populations and spatially-defined stock units. The approaches include: (i) status quo management, (ii) “weakest link” management, (iii) spatial and temporal closures, (iv) stock composition analysis, and (v) alteration of stock boundaries. We highlight case studies in the North Atlantic that illustrate each approach and synthesize the lessons learned from these real-world applications. Alignment of biological and management units requires continual monitoring through the application of stock identification methods in conjunction with responsive management to preserve biocomplexity and the natural stability and resilience of fish species.},

Sediments that are presently in contact with the lower boundary of the denitrification zone indicate marked changes in the intermediate and bottom waters ventilation of OMZ during the past 9,500 years. The δ15N of sediment suggests that the OMZ waters were less ventilated during the early Holocene (between 9.5 and 8.5 ka BP) resulting in intensified denitrifying conditions with an average δ15N value of 7.8‰, while at the same time stable Mo isotope composition (average δ98Mo of −0.02‰) indicates that the bottom waters that were in contact with the sediments were better oxygenated. By the mid-Holocene OMZ became more oxygenated suppressing denitrification (average δ15N of 6.2‰), while bottom waters gradually became less oxygenated (average δ98Mo of 1.7‰). The mid-Holocene reduction in denitrification coincided with a global decrease in atmospheric N2O as inferred from ice core records, which is consistent with a decreased contribution from the Arabian Sea. Since 5.5 ka BP OMZ waters have again been undergoing progressive deoxygenation accompanied by increasing denitrification.},

  abstract = {Maritime and coastal cultural landscape, encompassing land and sea, and underwater is an important part of our cultural resources in the coastal areas. Although, integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) has theoretically addressed the importance of cultural ecosystems, cultural resources have mostly been overlooked in holistic coastal management plans. Overlooking cultural resources results in loss of cultural identity associated with certain habitats; loss of tourism, recreational and educational opportunities; decline in local ecological knowledge, skills and technology pertaining to habitat management; and loss of opportunities for social and cultural capital. Literature and practice show that there is no proper definition and evaluation of coastal cultural heritage is available and coastal cultural heritage has not been considered as a resource with high level of benefit for development and people. Acknowledging the importance of coastal cultural heritage as a resource in ICZM, and the role that ICZM can play in linking land and sea management approaches highlights the necessity of new methods for defining and evaluation of coastal cultural heritage. This paper proposes models and guidelines for defining and evaluating coastal cultural heritage to be included in Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and ICZM as a resource through application of the integrative complexity theory and learning from the experiences in management of other coastal resources. The results will be an integrative evaluation method and a guideline for delineating coastal cultural areas. The method and tool will be examined through the case of Ostend in Belgium.},

  abstract = {Pacific salmon are a dominant component of the northeast Pacific ecosystem. Their status is of concern because salmon abundance is highly variable—including protected stocks, a recently closed fishery, and actively managed fisheries that provide substantial ecosystem services. Variable ocean conditions, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), have influenced these fisheries, while diminished diversity of freshwater habitats have increased variability via the portfolio effect. We address the question of how recent changes in ocean conditions will affect populations of two salmon species. Since the 1980s, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have been more frequently associated with central tropical Pacific warming (CPW) rather than the canonical eastern Pacific warming ENSO (EPW). CPW is linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), whereas EPW is linked to the PDO, different indicators of northeast Pacific Ocean ecosystem productivity. Here we show that both coho and Chinook salmon survival rates along western North America indicate that the NPGO, rather than the PDO, explains salmon survival since the 1980s. The observed increase in NPGO variance in recent decades was accompanied by an increase in coherence of local survival rates of these two species, increasing salmon variability via the portfolio effect. Such increases in coherence among salmon stocks are usually attributed to controllable freshwater influences such as hatcheries and habitat degradation, but the unknown mechanism underlying the ocean climate effect identified here is not directly subject to management actions.},

  abstract = {Nest site fidelity and serial polyandry were examined in lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, a teleost fish in which the nest-guarding male parent invests more heavily in parental care than the elusive female parent. Lingcod parental and progeny genotypes were established for fish spawning on a 200 m2 section of Snake Island reef, British Columbia in two successive years to evaluate male and female mate choice (monogamy or polygamy) and nest site reuse by the same parents (nest site fidelity) and/or different parents (nest site affinity). Thirteen nests (egg masses) guarded by nine males and 14 nests guarded by seven males were observed in 2002 and 2003, respectively. No female laid more than one nest per season or spawned in the study area in both years. In contrast, at least six (86\%) and possibly all seven (100\%) of the 2003 guardian males had been guardian or auxiliary males in 2002. Both nest site affinity and extreme male nest site fidelity were observed, with at least four males reusing the exact same nest site. Serial polyandry resulting from the high male and low female nest site fidelity is consistent with predictions based on a low female parental investment and high rate of progeny loss to predation and cannibalism. Male polygyny, achieved primarily by cuckoldry within seasons, was enhanced by the lack of female fidelity between seasons. Polygamy in both sexes of nest-tending marine fish may minimize reproductive skew and maximize genetic diversity within populations.},

These tools, although particularly well suited to the behavioral sciences, have several potential pitfalls. Among other things, there is no statistical test for evaluating the significance of the results. This paper provides estimates of the statistical significance of results yielded by Kruskal's nonmetric multidimensional scaling. The estimates, obtained from attempts to scale many randomly generated sets of data, reveal the relative frequency with which apparent structure is erroneously found in unstructured data. For a small number of points (i.e., six or seven) it is very likely that a good fit will be obtained in two or more dimensions when in fact the data are generated by a random process. The estimates presented here can be used as a bench mark against which to evaluate the significance of the results obtained from empirically based nonmetric multidimensional scaling.},

  abstract = {Many studies illustrate variable patterns in individual species distribution shifts in response to changing temperature. However, an assemblage, a group of species that shares a common environmental niche, will likely exhibit similar responses to climate changes, and these community-level responses may have significant implications for ecosystem function. Therefore, we examine the relationship between observed shifts of species in assemblages and regional climate velocity (i.e., the rate and direction of change of temperature isotherms). The assemblages are defined in two sub-regions of the U.S. Northeast Shelf that have heterogeneous oceanography and bathymetry using four decades of bottom trawl survey data and we explore temporal changes in distribution, spatial range extent, thermal habitat area, and biomass, within assemblages. These sub-regional analyses allow the dissection of the relative roles of regional climate velocity and local physiography in shaping observed distribution shifts. We find that assemblages of species associated with shallower, warmer waters tend to shift west-southwest and to shallower waters over time, possibly towards cooler temperatures in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Maine, while species assemblages associated with relatively cooler and deeper waters shift deeper, but with little latitudinal change. Conversely, species assemblages associated with warmer and shallower water on the broad, shallow continental shelf from the Mid-Atlantic Bight to Georges Bank shift strongly northeast along latitudinal gradients with little change in depth. Shifts in depth among the southern species associated with deeper and cooler waters are more variable, although predominantly shifts are toward deeper waters. In addition, spatial expansion and contraction of species assemblages in each region corresponds to the area of suitable thermal habitat, but is inversely related to assemblage biomass. This suggests that assemblage distribution shifts in conjunction with expansion or contraction of thermal habitat acts to compress or stretch marine species assemblages, which may respectively amplify or dilute species interactions to an extent that is rarely considered. Overall, regional differences in climate change effects on the movement and extent of species assemblages hold important implications for management, mitigation, and adaptation on the U.S. Northeast Shelf.},

  abstract = {The U.S. Northeast Continental Shelf marine ecosystem has warmed much faster than the global ocean and it is expected that this enhanced warming will continue through this century. Complex bathymetry and ocean circulation in this region have contributed to biases in global climate model simulations of the Shelf waters. Increasing the resolution of these models results in reductions in the bias of future climate change projections and indicates greater warming than suggested by coarse resolution climate projections. Here, we used a high-resolution global climate model and historical observations of species distributions from a trawl survey to examine changes in the future distribution of suitable thermal habitat for various demersal and pelagic species on the Shelf. Along the southern portion of the shelf (Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank), a projected 4.1 °C (surface) to 5.0 °C (bottom) warming of ocean temperature from current conditions results in a northward shift of the thermal habitat for the majority of species. While some southern species like butterfish and black sea bass are projected to have moderate losses in suitable thermal habitat, there are potentially significant increases for many species including summer flounder, striped bass, and Atlantic croaker. In the north, in the Gulf of Maine, a projected 3.7 °C (surface) to 3.9 °C (bottom) warming from current conditions results in substantial reductions in suitable thermal habitat such that species currently inhabiting this region may not remain in these waters under continued warming. We project a loss in suitable thermal habitat for key northern species including Acadian redfish, American plaice, Atlantic cod, haddock, and thorney skate, but potential gains for some species including spiny dogfish and American lobster. We illustrate how changes in suitable thermal habitat of important commercially fished species may impact local fishing communities and potentially impact major fishing ports along the U.S. Northeast Shelf. Given the complications of multiple drivers including species interactions and fishing pressure, it is difficult to predict exactly how species will shift. However, observations of species distribution shifts in the historical record under ocean warming suggest that temperature will play a primary role in influencing how species fare. Our results provide critical information on the potential for suitable thermal habitat on the U.S. Northeast Shelf for demersal species in the region, and may contribute to the development of ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies in response to climate change.},

We report the apparent impact of declining oxygen on midwater fishes within the OMZ of the southern California Current (CC). Principal component analysis of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) ichthyoplankton time series from 1951 to 2008 indicates that the dominant temporal pattern (principal component 1 [PC1]) represents the marked decline of the region’s mesopelagic fishes during periods of reduced oxygen. Of the 27 taxa with loadings {$>$} 0.5 on PC1, 24 were mesopelagic. PC1 was strongly correlated with intermediate-water oxygen concentrations (r = 0.75, p {$<$} 0.05), which were about 20\% lower in the past decade and the 1950s than in the period from 1970 to 1995. The abundance of mesopelagic fishes represented by PC1 was reduced, on average, by 63\% between periods of high and low oxygen concentrations. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism is the shoaling of the hypoxic boundary layer during periods of reduced oxygen, which renders the mesopelagic fauna more vulnerable to visually orienting predators. The mesopelagic fish fauna provides a vital trophodynamic link between the marine plankton and many higher predators. The decline of deepwater fish populations has profound implications for commercial fisheries, marine food webs and marine conservation: climate models predict a 20 to 40\% decline in global deepwater oxygen concentrations over the coming century.},

Sources of error and bias associated with two of the components used to compute area swept as a measure of fishing effort, distance fished by the trawl and net spread, are systematically examined and their influence quantified using both simulated and survey data. New analytical methods, a cubic spline smoothing algorithm to smooth GPS and net spread data, a haversine great circle algorithm to calculate distance between smoothed GPS track points, and a sequential outlier rejection algorithm to diminish the influence of noise on mean net spread estimates are shown to reduce or even eliminate the influence of biased observations on area swept estimators.},

This investigation is the first to include data for the 2006–2010 cold period and to use between-year comparisons of local and shelf-wide spatial indices to test specific responses to three different isothermal boundaries within the cold pool. Distributional shifts in population varied considerably among species and directional vectors for some species were greater in magnitude to the east or west than to the north or south; however, in general, eastern Bering Sea shelf populations shifted southward in response to the increasing cold pool size, and after accounting for differences in temperature and population abundance, there was still a temporal northward shift in populations over the last three decades despite the recent cooling trend. Model results for local and shelf-wide indices showed that survey time lag and cold pool extent had a greater effect on spatial distribution than population abundance, suggesting that density-independent mechanisms play a major role in shaping distribution patterns on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The area enclosed by the 1°C isotherm most commonly affects both local and shelf-wide spatial indices suggesting that 1°C is a more important boundary for describing temperature preferences of eastern Bering Sea bottom fishes and crabs than is the 2°C isotherm used for designating the physical boundary for the cold pool.},

  abstract = {This study uses a 30-year time series of standardized bottom trawl survey data (1982–2011) from the eastern Bering Sea shelf to model patterns of summer spatial distribution for various bottom fishes and crabs in response to changes in the areal extent of the cold pool, time lag between surveys, and fluctuations in population abundance. This investigation is the first to include data for the 2006–2010 cold period and to use between-year comparisons of local and shelf-wide spatial indices to test specific responses to three different isothermal boundaries within the cold pool. Distributional shifts in population varied considerably among species and directional vectors for some species were greater in magnitude to the east or west than to the north or south; however, in general, eastern Bering Sea shelf populations shifted southward in response to the increasing cold pool size, and after accounting for differences in temperature and population abundance, there was still a temporal northward shift in populations over the last three decades despite the recent cooling trend. Model results for local and shelf-wide indices showed that survey time lag and cold pool extent had a greater effect on spatial distribution than population abundance, suggesting that density-independent mechanisms play a major role in shaping distribution patterns on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The area enclosed by the 1°C isotherm most commonly affects both local and shelf-wide spatial indices suggesting that 1°C is a more important boundary for describing temperature preferences of eastern Bering Sea bottom fishes and crabs than is the 2°C isotherm used for designating the physical boundary for the cold pool.},

  abstract = {The Thomas Fire ignited on December 5, 2017 and burned nearly 300,000 acres of land in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties until January 12, 2018, making it the largest wildfire in California history at the time. During the fire, a persistent plume of ash, smoke, and soot extended up to 1,000 km offshore over the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC). The effect of this ash influx on the SBC phytoplankton community was investigated with an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) onboard R/V Sally Ride during a research cruise in mid-December 2017. Over 100,000 images of phytoplankton and nonliving particles were collected and each image was manually classified, resulting in time series of phytoplankton cells and detrital particles, including ash. Comparing the Thomas Fire conditions to historical monthly sampling in the SBC in December reveals significant differences in sea surface temperature, nutrient concentration, and phytoplankton community composition (PCC) in December 2017. During the Thomas Fire, dinoflagellates dominated the phytoplankton community (comprising up to 90\% of the total phytoplankton cell biovolume per sample), while diatoms and picophytoplankton typically dominate surface ocean PCC in the SBC in December. While this study was not able to demonstrate a correlational relationship between PCC and wildfire ash concentration, the significant differences in surface ocean biogeochemistry in December 2017 compared to past winters is notable. Wildfire severity and frequency are annually increasing in California and globally with unknown impacts on the marine ecosystem; thus, this study provides an important baseline assessment for the SBC.},

  abstract = {The first year is typically a bottleneck for juvenile fishes and survival at this stage can be dictated by environmental conditions affecting growth, such as temperature and food availability. Shifts in environmental conditions—and the resulting effects on growth—are of particular concern for high latitude species, which are experiencing more pronounced impacts of climate change. We measured effects of temperature on growth, consumption, and respiration of young-of-year (YOY) Sablefish (218–289~mm TL; Anoplopoma fimbria) in laboratory trials. Physiological response functions were used to outfit a novel, life stage specific bioenergetics model. Average daily growth rates ranged from 0.82 to 3.42~g d−1 (46.7 to 122~J~g−1 d−1), with optimum growth occurring at 12–16~°C and declining substantially outside of this range. We then validated the model by comparing model estimates of growth to known growth rates for a separate cohort of Sablefish reared under controlled conditions. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the consumption-related parameters had the greatest influence on model outputs. As such, consumption parameters should be determined with care. Finally, we used the model to characterize the conditions necessary for wild YOY Sablefish to successfully settle from neustonic to demersal stages by modeling temperature-prey scenarios that reflect the transition from neustonic offshore to demersal nearshore habitats observed over the period from August to October. Our findings suggest that Sablefish in the Gulf of Alaska could thrive under warming ocean conditions given sufficient food, which corroborates reports of high Sablefish recruitment events following a marine heat wave in 2014.},

  abstract = {Marine and fisheries scientists are increasingly using metapopulation concepts to better understand and model their focal systems. Consequently, they are considering what defines a metapopulation. One perspective on this question emphasizes the importance of extinction probability in local populations. This view probably stems from the focus on extinction in Levins' original metapopulation model, but places unnecessary emphasis on extinction–recolonization dynamics. Metapopulation models with more complex structure than Levins' patch-occupancy model and its variants allow a broader range of population phenomena to be examined, such as changes in population size, age structure and genetic structure. Analyses along these lines are critical in fisheries science, where presence–absence resolution is far too coarse to understand stock dynamics in a meaningful way. These more detailed investigations can, but need not, aim to assess extinction risk or deal with extinction-prone local populations. Therefore, we emphasize the coupling of spatial scales as the defining feature of metapopulations. It is the degree of demographic connectivity that characterizes metapopulations, with the dynamics of local populations strongly dependent upon local demographic processes, but also influenced by a nontrivial element of external replenishment. Therefore, estimating rates of interpopulation exchange must be a research priority. We contrast metapopulations with other spatially structured populations that differ in the degree of local closure of their component populations. We conclude with consideration of the implications of metapopulation structure for spatially explicit management, particularly the design of marine protected area networks.},

Most of these factors were probably operating during the Holocene transgression of the sea which deposited a basal sand facies over the shelf. As sea level approached its present position, mud (silt and clay) began to accumulate slowly on the mid-and outer-shelf. Through the reworking by benthic organisms, this mud was mixed into the underlying basal sand creating a mixed mud and sand facies. A mud facies developed in the vicinity of the Columbia, Umpqua, and Rogue Rivers where the rate of mud deposition exceeded the reworking activity. The drowned mouths of coastal estuaries produce a sediment trap for fluvial and marine sand and the silts and clays that come in contact with the intruding salt wedge. The grain size modes of the modern shelf sediments suggest that the very fine sand (3-4Ø) and finer material are presently transported in suspension through estuaries with a high fresh-water discharge and a large sediment input. This material diffuses through the turbulent surf zone and emerges as three distinct turbid layers on the continental shelf: (1) a surface layer at the seasonal thermocline, (2) a mid-water layer at the permanent pycnocline, and (3) a bottom turbid layer. During the winter, long-period surface waves from the southwest stir the bottom to water depths of 200 m and, when combined with bottom currents associated with internal and surface tides and northward flowing subsurface currents, provide the mechanism to transport very fine sand across the 45-km wide shelf off the Columbia River. This stirring process resuspends previously deposited bottom sediments which are then carried to the lower continental slope in low-density flows. The bulk of the silt and clay, as well as the biogenic debris in the water column, probably bypasses the shelf in the surface and mid-water layers and is deposited on the lower continental slope. Summer waves have shorter periods and are from the northwest, with bottom stirring occurring only to depths of 90 m on the average. These conditions favor deposition of silts and clays on the mid- and outer-shelf. While the fluvial sediment supply from small, coastal rivers is substantially decreased at this time, the discharge from the Columbia River reaches a maximum during the onset of these moderate wave conditions. The sand facies, particularly on the inner shelf, consists of relict sand and gravel or mixtures of these relict deposits and modern sands. The modern mud facies is a transient feature in some areas of the shelf; its presence is largely controlled by the resuspension processes and sediment input on the continental shelf.}

We discuss key aspects of genetic population structure in the context of identifying biological units for fisheries management, suggesting three basic types of structuring: distinct populations; continuous change; and no differentiation. The type of structure determines how units for genetically sustainable management are to be identified. We also review what is currently known regarding the genetic population structure of fishes exploited in the Swedish part of the Baltic Sea, and conclude that sufficient genetic information is lacking for most of the species. This is a serious problem, particularly considering that populations of several commercially exploited fishes are declining and some exhibit recruitment problems. For six species, Atlantic herring, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, European eel, turbot, and pike, sufficient genetic data are available to provide at least basic information on genetic structure and genetic units for biologically sustainable use. Current management practices do not sufficiently consider these data.},

Analyses were carried out using both generalised additive models and boosted regression trees (sometimes referred to as ‘stochastic gradient boosting’). Depth was the single most important environmental predictor of variation in species richness, with highest richness occurring at depths of 900 to 1000 m, and with a broad plateau of moderately high richness between 400 and 1100 m. Richness was higher both in waters with high surface concentrations of chlorophyll a and in zones of mixing of water bodies of contrasting origins. Local variation in temperature was also important, with lower richness occurring in waters that were cooler than expected given their depth. Variables describing trawl length, trawl speed, and cod-end mesh size made a substantial contribution to analysis outcomes, even though functions fitted for trawl distance and cod-end mesh size were constrained to reflect the known performance of trawl gear. Species richness declined with increasing cod-end mesh size and increasing trawl speed, but increased with increasing trawl distance, reaching a plateau once trawl distances exceed about 3 nautical miles. Boosted regression trees provided a powerful analysis tool, giving substantially superior predictive performance to generalized additive models, despite the fitting of interaction terms in the latter.},

High atmospheric CO2 and warm climates in the Cretaceous have been attributed to enhanced volcanic emissions of CO2 through more rapid spreading at mid-ocean ridges and, in particular, to a global flare-up in continental arc volcanism. Here, we show that global flare-ups in continental arc magmatism also enhance the global flux of nutrients into the ocean through production of windblown ash. We show that up to 75\% of Si, Fe and P is leached from windblown ash during and shortly after deposition, with soluble Si, Fe and P inputs from ash alone in the Cretaceous being higher than the combined input of dust and rivers today. Ash-derived nutrient inputs may have increased the efficiency of biological productivity and organic carbon preservation in the Cretaceous, possibly explaining why the carbon isotopic signature of Cretaceous seawater was high. Variations in volcanic activity, particularly continental arcs, have the potential of profoundly altering carbon cycling at the Earth’s surface by increasing inputs of CO2 and ash-borne nutrients, which together enhance biological productivity and burial of organic carbon, generating an abundance of hydrocarbon source rocks.},

  abstract = {Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics in marine fish populations is essential for the development of effective adaptive management strategies. Many marine fish species undergo ontogenetic shifts in abundance, with the utilization of productive shelf-based habitats during early life-history stages. For instance, in the shelf ecosystem around the Falkland Islands, a dynamic Patagonian toothfish population undertakes an early life-history ontogenetic migration after recruitment from spawning areas off southern Chile and the Burdwood Bank. To better understand the spatial-temporal dynamics for this species, Bayesian species distribution models were used to (1) identify oceanographic drivers of recruitment success; (2) assess the spatial-temporal distribution patterns; and (3) describe the habitat preferences and ecological interactions during a six-year study period (2015–2020) on the Patagonian Shelf. The presence of seasonal mesoscale eddies linking the Sub-Antarctic Front with the Falkland Current appear to be of primary importance for the survival of toothfish eggs and larvae on the shelf after transport from offshore spawning areas over the Burdwood Bank and southern Chile. Results indicate persistent recruitment hotspots for newly-settled Patagonian toothfish to the north-east, along with opportunistic areas to the south and west of the Falkland Islands, coinciding with the main areas of upwelling and high productivity. During years of low recruitment, juveniles are largely constrained to sheltered inshore regions to the north-west of the Falkland Islands. Spatial distribution patterns during post-settlement ontogenetic migrations are progressive, characterised by age-structured hotspots that differ according to depth, current velocity, oxygen, mixed-layer thickness, the abundance of competitors (icefish – Champsocephalus esox) and prey (rock cod – Patagonotothen ramsayi). The temporal shift in the range and intensity of hotspots is linked to levels of recruitment and subsequent cohort strength, which in turn appears to be driven by oceanographic processes. Understanding the environmental influences on recruitment dynamics is a key step in assessing connectivity within these discrete spatial groups on the Patagonian Shelf, and how their variability can influence the adult population over time.},

In addition, sablefish could withstand upper temperatures only slightly lower than salmon [critical thermal maximum (CTmax) \textasciitilde 24.9\,°C vs. \textasciitilde 26.2\,°C, respectively]. Sablefish juveniles were both less hypoxia and thermally tolerant than adults [critical O2 tension \textasciitilde 18.9\% vs. \textasciitilde 15.8\% air saturation; CTmax \textasciitilde 22.7 vs. \textasciitilde 24.9\,°C, respectively]. Interestingly, many of these differences in environmental tolerance could not be explained by differences in metabolic parameters (aerobic scope or routine metabolic rate). Our findings show that sablefish are tolerant of high temperatures, and very tolerant of hypoxia, traits that are advantageous for an aquaculture species in the era of climate change.},

  abstract = {Female Pacific sanddab were collected from the Monterey Bay, California to describe their reproductive strategy and annual reproductive cycle, as well as to estimate length at maturity, fecundity, spawning fraction (SF), and spawning interval (SI). Captive females were held to examine degradation of spawning markers and confirmed the biological spawning capabilities of the species. The reproductive season extended from May through January, as determined through macroscopic and histological examination of ovaries. Oocyte development was asynchronous, and an indeterminate fecundity pattern was displayed. Absolute and relative batch fecundity values were variable (means = 6663 eggs and 54 eggs g−1 somatic weight, respectively) and significantly related to maternal length. During the period of highest reproductive activity, SF ranged from 0.42 to 0.98, suggesting some females were spawning on a daily basis. Monthly SF and SI were related to length, with smaller females having a truncated season and lower SF compared to larger females. Lengths at 50\% (119 mm) and 95\% (149 mm) maturity showed a downward shift relative to the 1940s, though the magnitude and cause of this shift remain unknown. This study highlights the importance of considering demographic shifts and size-related dynamics when modeling a stock's reproductive potential.},

  abstract = {We used literature reports to evaluate the hypotheses that: 1. year-class strenght in marine fishes is determined by mortality operating during the pre-juvenile stage of the life history, and 2. recruitment in marine fishes can be regulated by starvation and predation in the egg and larval stages. The available evidence is largely consistent with the first hypothesis, although mortality operating during the juvenile and post-juvenile stage may moderate the variation induced at the pre-juvenile stage. The hypothesis that recruitment can be regulated by starvation during the larval stage was assessed in relation to Hjort's ‘critical period’ and Cushing's ‘match-mismatch rs hypotheses. The available evidence does not support a major link between food abundance at the time of first feeding, and recruitment (Hjort's ‘critical period’). The hypothesized relationship between recruitment and the coincidence between the seasonal timing of plankton production and the seasonal abundance of larvae (Cushing's ‘match-mismatch’) is generally supported. However, the relationships are weak and the importance of the strength of the coupling between seasonal cycles in plankton and larval abundance appears to be weaker than had previously been surmised. Recent evidence, which suggests that failure to distinguish between food abundance in the environment and the availability of food to individual larvae may have comprimised the evaluation of these hypotheses, is reviewed. The relationship between mortality due to predation and its potential effects on recruitment was evaluated with reference to two emerging paradigms, the ‘bigger is better’ and the ‘stage duration’ hypotheses. We conclude that failure to fully evaluate the assumptions underlying these hypotheses may have led to erroneous generalizations regarding the importance of size at age/stage and growth rate on the probability of death due to predation. Neither the ‘bigger is better’, nor the ‘stage duration’ hypotheses is unequivocally supported.},

  abstract = {Declining ocean health, increasing human demands on marine ecosystems, and a history of management focused on individual activities, species or sectors has led to calls for more comprehensive, integrated management that considers entire coupled social-ecological systems. This transition to ecosystem-based management (EBM) for the oceans will certainly face a number of hurdles, and many practitioners struggle with how to move forward with EBM. In this paper, we assess whether the necessary science exists to support EBM. Specifically, we evaluate the state of the social and natural sciences for three research areas that are critical to EBM: (1) ecosystem services, (2) cumulative impacts, and (3) ecosystem variability and change. For each of the three research areas, we describe its importance to EBM and assess existing and emerging information and application of this knowledge, focusing on the US West Coast. We conclude that available science is not the bottleneck for moving forward with comprehensive EBM for this region, although we highlight important remaining knowledge gaps, particularly within the social sciences. Given imperfect and uncertain knowledge, EBM calls for an adaptive management approach, starting with readily available information, and continuously adapting as new information emerges. This synthesis can serve as a basis for comparison for other regions; it provides guidance for organizing information in support of EBM and outlines many novel and broadly applicable scientific approaches.},

Individuals respond to patchiness in their environments by movement patterns, by allocation strategies, and by other mechanisms. On an evolutionary timescale, these responses to variability change the scales on which organisms perceive the environment; and through the effects of individuals on their environments, such evolutionary responses alter the ecological and evolutionary context experienced by other organisms. Understanding the causes and consequences thus requires an understanding of individual responses, and of how those responses lead to non-uniform patterns of distribution. In this paper, the dynamics of aggregation are explored from both a terrestrial and a marine perspective. Through a spectrum of models that are individual-based, aggregations are seen to develop, and macroscopic descriptions are derived.},

  abstract = {Improved understanding and management of social-ecological systems (SES) requires collaboration between biophysical and social scientists; however, issues related to research philosophy and approaches, the nature of data, and language hinder interdisciplinary science. Here, we discuss how we used conceptual models to promote interdisciplinary dialogue in support of integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs) in the California Current ecosystem. Initial conceptualizations of the California Current IEA were based on the DriverPressure-State-Impact-Response framework. This initial framing was biophysically centered, with humans primarily incorporated as impacts on the system. We wished to move from a conceptualization that portrayed an antagonistic relationship between humans and nature to one that integrated humans and social systems into the IEA framework. We propose a new conceptualization of the California Current that functions across temporal and spatial scales, captures the diverse relationships that typify SESs, and highlights the need for interdisciplinary science. The development of this conceptualization reveals how our understanding of the place and role of people in the ecosystem changed over the course of the history of the California Current IEA. This conceptual model is adaptive and serves to ensure that interdisciplinarity will now be the standard for the California Current IEA and, perhaps, beyond.},

  abstract = {The management of marine resources is a politically and culturally driven process, shaped by human livelihoods and perceptions, where notions of both space and place shape policies and decision-making in fundamental ways. An emerging sub-field within geography critically explores geographic aspects of marine resource management. However, there has been little work to fully articulate this field and to describe the contributions of geographic methodologies and lenses to understanding marine resource management processes. This special issue provides one of the first collections of geographic papers focused on the socio-cultural and socio-spatial dimensions of marine resource management, emphasizing research that has or can be applied to management and policy discussions. The papers in this issue cover critical topics within this emerging field, examining the combined influences of social, ecological, cultural, political, economic, historical, and geographic factors on how marine spaces and resources are used, perceived, and managed. Important themes include: emerging spatial approaches to marine resource management, human dimensions of marine protected areas, the roles of mapping and GIS, the integration of quantitative and qualitative data, and the varying ways in which marine spaces and places are conceptualized by marine resource users and managers. Issues of marine resource governance, community engagement, and vulnerability also play key roles in the future of marine resource management. The papers in this issue shed light on space, place, and human-environment interactions in coastal marine systems, making it clear that questions about stakeholder inclusion and representation, particularly in spatial forms, will continue to dominate the field for some time to come. Future research in this field will be fruitfully informed by core geographical heuristics of space, place, and humanenvironment dynamics.},

Although examples of climate-forced distribution shifts abound, it is unclear how these shifts are practically accounted for in the management of fish stocks. In particular, how can we take into account shifting stock distribution in the context of stock assessments and their management outputs? Here, we discuss examples of the types of fish stock distribution shifts that can occur. We then propose a decision tree framework of how shifting stock distributions can be addressed. Generally, the approaches for addressing such shifts fall into one of three main alternatives: re-evaluate stock identification, re-evaluate a stock unit area, or implement spatially explicit modelling. We conclude by asserting that the approach recommended here is feasible with existing information and as such fisheries managers should be able to begin addressing the role of changes in stock distribution in these fish stocks. The implications of not doing so could be notably undesirable.},

An index of local climate (1960–2005), and data from commercial fishery catches (1960–2004) and from small-mesh trawl surveys (1972–2005) are used to assess the impacts of these climate events in the Subarctic Gulf of Alaska. Non-linear regression showed that survey catch composition strongly responded to local climate at lags of 2 and 4 years, providing evidence of rapid ecological response to climate change in the system. A sequential regime shift detection method identified rapid change in local climate, and in survey and commercial catches following the well-documented regime shift to a positive state of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 1976/1977. However, the analysis failed to detect the 1998/1999 regime shift in local climate, or in survey or commercial catches. This result is consistent with the view that the 1998/1999 climate regime shift did not represent a reversion to a negative PDO state. Local temperature increased and local sea level pressure decreased in the Gulf of Alaska during the years 2001–2005, consistent with anthropogenic warming and recent spatial reorganization in Arctic climate. There was no evidence of community reorganization following this climate event. Further observation will be required to evaluate the persistence of this new climate pattern, and the nature of community reaction to it.},

  abstract = {Studies of climate effects on ecology often account for non-stationarity in individual physical and biological variables, but rarely allow for non-stationary relationships among variables. Here, we show that non-stationary relationships among physical and biological variables are central to understanding climate effects on salmon (Onchorynchus spp.) in the Gulf of Alaska during 1965–2012. The relative importance of two leading patterns in North Pacific climate, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), changed around 1988/1989 as reflected by changing correlations with leading axes of sea surface temperature variability. Simultaneously, relationships between the PDO and Gulf of Alaska environmental variables weakened, and long-standing temperature–salmon and PDO–salmon covariance declined to zero. We propose a mechanistic explanation for changing climate–salmon relationships in terms of non-stationary atmosphere–ocean interactions coinciding with changing PDO–NPGO relative importance. We also show that regression models assuming stationary climate–salmon relationships are inappropriate over the multidecadal time scale we consider. Relaxing assumptions of stationary relationships markedly improved modelling of climate effects on salmon catches and productivity. Attempts to understand the implications of changing climate patterns in other ecosystems might also be aided by the application of models that allow associations among environmental and biological variables to change over time.},

  abstract = {We used an indicator approach to address outstanding questions concerning the ecological importance of low-frequency climate variability in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Our data consist of a previously-published set of 33 climate and 64 biology time series, updated by us for the years 1965–2011 (for climate data) and 1965–2008 (for biology data). A model-selection approach showed that the first axis of variability in large-scale climate indices (PC1ci), the first and second axes for local climate parameters (PC1cp and PC2cp) and the second axis for biological variability (PC2biol) all showed temporal variability best described by abrupt shifts. In contrast, PC1biol showed gradual, rather than abrupt, temporal variability, suggesting that the leading axis of biological variability was not dominated by abrupt transitions following climate regime shifts. The leading mode of variability in detrended North Pacific sea surface temperature, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, showed reduced amplitude from the late 1980s until the mid-2000s, and we found that this change in PDO behavior was associated with a decline in the strength of the leading pattern of basin-scale biological variability (PC1biol). A reversion to a PDO-negative state in the winter of 2007/08 was associated with the largest observed annual change in the PC1bio–PC2bio phase space, suggesting renewed ecological importance of the PDO. However, a subset of biology time series (n = 23) for which more recent data were available did not show persistent change in PC1bio or PC2bio during 2008–2011, thus failing to support the hypothesis of widespread ecological response to the putative 2007/08 shift. To further assess the possible ecological importance of low-frequency climate variability in recent years, we compared changes in the PDO-North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) phase space for 2007/08 with ecologically important (1976/77) and less important (1988/89) climate regime shifts of the past. We found that all three shifts involved PDO-NPGO variability of similar magnitude (i.e., similar pulse disturbances), but that the 1976/77 shift was followed by a period of stability in a new climate state (i.e., strong press disturbance), while the 1988/89 shift was not followed by a period of stability (weak press disturbance). Data through 2013 suggest that the press disturbance following 2007/08 is similar to that following 1976/77, implying that the putative 2007/08 shift may eventually prove to be ecologically important. Our ‘‘pulse-press’’ approach provides a formal framework for distinguishing transient and persistent climate perturbations at the ends of time series.},

Tests occurred off Washington during 2011 aboard a commercial trawler. A recapture net was used to quantify the retention rates of target and non-target species. Pacific halibut bycatch was reduced 61.6\% by weight and 57.0\% by numbers. Exclusion was greatest for Pacific halibut weighing more than 4.5kg. A significant difference in the mean total length was also noted between Pacific halibut caught in the codend and the recapture net, with larger fish occurring in the recapture net. The retention of primary target groundfishes of marketable-size ranged from 76.7 to 89.3\%. We demonstrated the capability of a flexible sorting grid excluder to reduce Pacific halibut bycatch in the groundfish bottom trawl fishery while retaining a relatively high proportion of the targeted species.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) has gained international popularity in recent years, but the lack of consensus on its definition has precluded the use of a universal implementation framework. The large number and variety of principles that make up EBM, and the diversity in perspectives among key management players, has impeded the practical application of EBM. Agreement on a list of the essential ingredients of EBM is vital to successful application. A frequency analysis of EBM principles was conducted to identify the Key Principles that currently define EBM, from a list of twenty-six principles extracted from a subset of the EBM theoretical/conceptual literature (covering a range of published sources across disciplines and application types). Fifteen Key Principles were identified (in descending frequency of appearance in the literature): Consider Ecosystem Connections, Appropriate Spatial \& Temporal Scales, Adaptive Management, Use of Scientific Knowledge, Integrated Management, Stakeholder Involvement, Account for Dynamic Nature of Ecosystems, Ecological Integrity \& Biodiversity, Sustainability, Recognise Coupled Social-Ecological Systems, Decisions reflect Societal Choice, Distinct Boundaries, Interdisciplinarity, Appropriate Monitoring, and Acknowledge Uncertainty. This paper also examines the development of EBM principles over time, leading to predictions on the directions EBM will take in the future. The frequency analysis methodology used here can be replicated to update the Key Principles of EBM in the future. Indeed, further research on potential emerging Key Principles such as ‘Consider Cumulative Impacts’, ‘Apply the Precautionary Approach’ and ‘Explicitly Acknowledge Trade Offs’ will help shape EBM and its successful application in the management of marine activities.},

  abstract = {Delimiting intraspecific genetic variation in harvested species is crucial to the assessment of population status for natural resource management and conservation purposes. Here, we evaluated genetic population structure in lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), a commercially and recreationally important fishery species along the west coast of North America. We used 16,749 restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) markers, in 611 individuals collected from across the bulk of the species range from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. In contrast to previous population genetic work on this species, we found strong evidence for two distinct genetic clusters. These groups separated latitudinally with a break near Point Reyes off Northern California, and there was a high frequency of admixed individuals in close proximity to the break. F-statistics corroborate this genetic break between northern and southern sampling sites, although most loci are characterized by low FST values, suggesting high gene flow throughout most of the genome. Outlier analyses identified 182 loci putatively under divergent selection, most of which mapped to a single genomic region. When individuals were grouped by cluster assignment (northern, southern, and admixed), 71 loci were fixed between the northern and southern cluster, all of which were identified in the outlier scans. All individuals identified as admixed exhibited near 50:50 assignment to northern and southern clusters and were heterozygous for most fixed loci. Alignments of RADseq loci to a draft lingcod genome assembly and three other teleost genomes with chromosome-level assemblies suggest that outlier and fixed loci are concentrated on a single chromosome. Similar genomic patterns have been attributed to chromosomal inversions in diverse taxonomic groups. Regardless of the evolutionary mechanism, these results represent novel observations of genetic structure in lingcod and designate clear evolutionary units that could be used to inform fisheries management.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: On continental shelves in arctic and subarctic seas, much of the production from spring blooms at the retreating ice edge may sink to the bottom with little grazing by zooplankton, thereby supporting abundant benthic communities. The importance of this settled phytoplankton to macrobenthos throughout the year may partly determine effects of long-term changes in ice cover. We studied organic matter (OM) pathways to macrobenthos and macrozooplankton under ice cover in late winter (March–April) and open water in late summer (September) in the north-central Bering Sea. In late winter 2001, only a very small fraction of OM in the water column was particulate. C:N ratios, δ13C, and δ15N in suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), and sediments indicated very little recent input of fresh ice algae or phytoplankton in ice-covered areas. For the 3 main deposit-feeding bivalves, δ13C and δ15N indicated similar diets among species, with minimal change in food quality between late summer and late winter, and between late winters with very different ice cover (1999 vs. 2001). In winter 2001, there were large increases in δ13C from SPOM to bulk sediments (+3.2‰) and from sediments to near-surface deposit-feeders (+1.6 to +3.0‰), but small differences in δ15N from SPOM to sediments (+1.2‰) and from sediments to deposit-feeders (–0.3 to +1.6‰). These values suggest that the diet of near-surface deposit-feeders during these non-bloom periods included substantial amounts of the cells or products of bacteria that had assimilated well-reworked carbon and isotopically light dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). By late summer and through winter, 4 to 11 mo after the spring bloom, products of bacterial activity appeared to be an important route of OM into the benthic food web. Due to bacterial dependence on annual carbon inputs, and unique nutrient content of fresh phytoplankton for breeding invertebrates, ice-edge blooms might be an important determinant of annual variations in macrobenthic abundance.}

  abstract = {The term river herring collectively refers to alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (A. aestivalis), two anadromous fishes distributed along the east coast of North America. Historically, river herring spawning migrations supported important fisheries, and their spawning runs continue to be of cultural significance to many coastal communities. Recently, substantial declines in spawning run size prompted a petition to consider river herring for listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA status review process requires an evaluation of a species’ response to multiple stressors, including climate change. For anadromous species that utilize a range of habitats throughout their life cycle, the response to a changing global climate is inherently complex and likely varies regionally. River herring occupy marine habitat for most of their lives, and we demonstrate that their relative abundance in the ocean has been increasing in recent years. We project potential effects of ocean warming along the US Atlantic coast on river herring in two seasons (spring and fall), and two future periods (2020–2060 and 2060–2100) by linking species distribution models to projected temperature changes from global climate models. Our analyses indicate that climate change will likely result in reductions in total suitable habitat across the study region, which will alter the marine distribution of river herring. We also project that density will likely decrease for both species in fall, but may increase in spring. Finally, we demonstrate that river herring may have increased sensitivity to climate change under a low abundance scenario. This result could be an important consideration for resource managers when planning for climate change because establishing effective conservation efforts in the near term may improve population resiliency and provide lasting benefits to river herring populations.},

We compared geopositioning data from juvenile white sharks fitted with acoustic (n=11) or satellite transmitters (n=13) to fisheries data to determine the degree and effect of white shark interactions with the gillnet fisheries in southern California. Between 2006 and 2008, set gillnet effort comprised a majority of the total gillnet effort (88\%) and both set gillnet and inshore drift gillnet effort were significantly and positively correlated with incidence of white shark capture (p{$<$}0.0001, τ=0.34 and 0.32) and number of satellite detections (p{$<$}0.0001, τ=0.34 and 0.33). However, spatial and temporal overlap of white sharks with gillnet fisheries was limited. Approximately 18\% of CDFW fishing blocks where white sharks were detected overlapped with blocks that were also heavily utilized by gillnet fisheries. Total gillnet effort tended to peak in the month of July before declining substantially whereas SPOT detections of tagged sharks were the most numerous in fall months. Although juvenile white sharks were shown to overlap with gillnet fisheries in their vertical, horizontal and temporal distributions, post-release survival of sharks retrieved live in gillnets was high (92.9\%). Sharks were more often found live in gillnets when net soak times were low. Therefore, continued research is needed to further evaluate the potential benefit of reducing soak times to improve incidental capture survival of white sharks at this age class.},

  abstract = {The high biological production of the California Current System (CCS) results from the seasonal development of equatorward alongshore winds that drive coastal upwelling. While several climatic fluctuation patterns influence the dynamics and biological productivity of the CCS, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), the mechanisms of interaction between climatic oscillations and the CCS upwelling dynamics have remained obscure. Here, we use Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) to reveal, for the first time, low-frequency concordance between the time series of climatic indices and upwelling intensity along the coast of western North America. Based on energy distributions in annual, semiannual and low-frequency signals, we can divide the coast into three distinct regions. While the annual upwelling signal dominates the energy spectrum elsewhere, low-frequency variability is maximal in the regions south of 33°N. Non-structured variability associated with storms and turbulent mixing is enhanced at northerly locations. We found that the low-frequency signal is significantly correlated with different climatic indices such as PDO, NPGO and ENSO with the correlation patterns being latitude-dependent. We also analyzed the correlations between this upwelling variability and sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) throughout the North Pacific to visualize and interpret the large-scale teleconnection dynamics in the atmosphere that drive the low-frequency coastal winds. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms connecting climatic patterns with upwelling dynamics, which could enhance our prediction and forecast capabilities of the effects of future oceanographic and climatic variability in the CCS.},

Yet the potential for non-stationary environmental effects across multiple dimensions, e.g. space and ontogeny, are rarely considered. In this study, we examined the evidence for spatial and ontogenetic non-stationary temperature effects on Pacific hake Merluccius productus biomass along the west coast of North America. Specifically, we used Bayesian additive models to estimate the effects of temperature on Pacific hake biomass distribution and whether the effects change across space or life-history stage. We found latitudinal differences in the effects of temperature on mature Pacific hake distribution (i.e. age 3 and older); warmer than average subsurface temperatures were associated with higher biomass north of Vancouver Island, but lower biomass offshore of Washington and southern Vancouver Island. In contrast, immature Pacific hake distribution (i.e. age 2) was better explained by a nonlinear temperature effect; cooler than average temperatures were associated with higher biomass coastwide. Together, our results suggest that Pacific hake distribution is driven by interactions between age composition and environmental conditions and highlight the importance of accounting for varying environmental effects across multiple dimensions.},

  abstract = {Resource managers and policy makers have long recognized the importance of considering fisheries in the context of ecosystems; yet, movement towards widespread Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management (EBFM) has been slow. A conceptual reframing of fisheries management is occurring globally, which envisions fisheries as systems with interacting biophysical and human subsystems. This broader view, along with a process for decision making, can facilitate implementation of EBFM. A pathway to achieve these broadened objectives of EBFM in the United States is a Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP). The first generation of FEPs was conceived in the late 1990s as voluntary guidance documents that Regional Fishery Management Councils could adopt to develop and guide their ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions, but few of these FEPs took concrete steps to implement EBFM. Here, we emphasize the need for a new generation of FEPs that provide practical mechanisms for putting EBFM into practice in the United States. We argue that next-generation FEPs can balance environmental, economic, and social objectives—the triple bottom line—to improve long-term planning for fishery systems.},

  abstract = {In addition to being an academic endeavour, the practical purpose of conducting age and growth studies on fishes is to provide biological data to stock assessment scientists and fisheries managers so they may better understand population demographics and manage exploitation rates. Age and size data are used to build growth models, which are a critical component of stock assessments. Though age determination of elasmobranchs in the northeast Pacific Ocean (NEP) began in the 1930s, the field has evolved substantially in recent years, allowing scientists to incorporate age data into assessments for more species than ever before. Owing to the highly diverse biology of this group of fishes, each species has its own set of challenges with regard to age determination. Age determination methods typically rely on semicalcified hard structures that form regular growth patterns; however, the structure selected and preparation method used is often species specific. New staining techniques have improved the ability to assess age and improve ageing precision for some species, and advances in microchemical methods have allowed for independent means of estimating age and validating age determination accuracy. Here we describe current age determination methods for NEP elasmobranchs. While the library of available techniques is increasing, there are still some NEP species for which reliable ageing methods have yet to be defined; we discuss these challenges and potential avenues of future research. Finally, we conclude by describing how age estimates are used in growth models and subsequently in stock assessments of selected NEP elasmobranchs.},

  abstract = {Recruitment is one of the most variable biological processes driving fisheries population dynamics and the characteristics and drivers of the variation differ among stocks. Understanding, describing (modeling), estimating, and predicting (forecasting) this variation is essential to appropriate stock assessment and fisheries management. Most modern stock assessments estimate annual variation in recruitment, particularly those that include age or size composition data. Changes over time are often partitioned into those related to the spawning biomass due to density dependence (the stock-recruitment relationship) and those related to other factors such as environmental conditions. Several methods have been used to model recruitment inside stock assessment models, and they differ by how recruitment is represented and how statistical inference is conducted. Virtual population analyses make few statistical assumptions about recruitment and instead calculate recruitment as the sum of the mortality-adjusted catches of a cohort while surplus production models generally imply a stock-recruitment relationship in their production function. Integrated statistical stock assessment models have modelled recruitment using a stock-recruitment relationship, autocorrelation, a function of covariates, regime shifts, or a combination of these. Statistical inference has typically been conducted using state-space (hierarchical) models, whether using Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods, or inferences are approximated using penalized likelihood approaches, which may not be statistically reliable. All these methods have specific issues that need to be addressed and there are tradeoffs in their use. Future temporal variation also needs to be considered when providing management advice. We review the theory and practice of modelling temporal variation in recruitment in fisheries stock assessment, provide advice on good practices, and recommend important research.},

  abstract = {Most spatial marine management techniques (e.g., marine protected areas) draw stationary boundaries around often mobile marine features, animals, or resource users. While these approaches can work for relatively stationary marine resources, to be most effective marine management must be as fluid in space and time as the resources and users we aim to manage. Instead, a shift towards dynamic ocean management is suggested, defined as management that rapidly changes in space and time in response to changes in the ocean and its users through the integration of near real-time biological, oceanographic, social and/or economic data. Dynamic management can refine the temporal and spatial scale of managed areas, thereby better balancing ecological and economic objectives. Temperature dependent habitat of a hypothetical mobile marine species was simulated to show the efficiency of dynamic management, finding that 82.0 to 34.2 percent less area needed to be managed using a dynamic approach. Dynamic management further complements existing management by increasing the speed at which decisions are implemented using predefined protocols. With advances in data collection and sharing, particularly in remote sensing, animal tracking, and mobile technology, managers are poised to apply dynamic management across numerous marine sectors. Existing examples demonstrate that dynamic management can successfully allow managers to respond rapidly to changes on-the-water, however to implement dynamic ocean management widely, several gaps must be filled. These include enhancing legal instruments, incorporating ecological and socioeconomic considerations simultaneously, developing ‘out-of-the-box’ platforms to serve dynamic management data to users, and developing applications broadly across additional marine resource sectors.},

PEW is characterized by higher temperatures and salinities, with lower pH, representing a source of potentially corrosive (aragonite, ) water to the region. We use ichthyoplankton assemblages near the cores of the California Current and the California Undercurrent to determine whether PEW influenced fish diversity. We use hydrographic data to characterize the interannual and seasonal variability of estimated pH and aragonite saturation with depth. Although there is substantial variability in PEW presence as measured by spice on the 26.25–26.75 isopycnal layer, as well as in pH and aragonite saturation, we found fish diversity to be stable over the decades 1985–1996 and 1999–2011. We detected significant difference in species structure during the 1998 La Niña period, due to reduced species evenness. Species richness due to rare species was higher during the 1997/1998 El Niño compared to the La Niña but the effect on species structure was undetectable. Lack of difference in the species abundance structure in the decade before and after the 1997/1999 ENSO event showed that the assemblage reverted to its former structure following the ENSO perturbation, indicating resilience. While the interdecadal species structure remained stable, the long tail of the distributions shows that species richness increased between the decades consistent with intrusion of warm water with more diverse assemblages into the southern California region.},

  abstract = {Marine particles play a central role in controlling the transport, cycling, and inventories of many major elements and trace elements and isotopes throughout the oceans. Studies seeking to elucidate the biogeochemical roles of marine particles often require reliable ways to collect them from the ocean. Here, we review the oceanographic toolbox of techniques and instrumentation that are employed to collect both suspended and sinking particles. With these tools, it is possible to determine both the concentrations and vertical fluxes of important elements and individual particle types. We describe the various methods for quantifying the concentrations of particulate matter with in situ pumps, towed sampling devices, bottle collectors, and large volume capture devices. The uses of various types of flux collection platforms are discussed including surface tethered, neutrally buoyant, and bottom moored devices. We address the issues of sediment trap collection biases and the apparent inconsistencies that can arise due to differences in the temporal and spatial scales sampled by the various methodologies. Special attention is given to collection considerations made for the analysis of trace metals and isotopes, as these methodologies are of high importance to the ongoing GEOTRACES program which seeks to identify the processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean. With the emergence of new particle collection methodologies and the continued reliance on traditional collection methods, it is imperative that we combine these multiple approaches in ways that will help improve their accuracy and precision while enhancing their utility in advancing understanding of the biogeochemical and ecological roles of marine particles.},

Possible explanations for the underutilization are (1) lack of infrastructure, (2) lack of market demand, and (3) low quota limits on some species restricting the ability to harvest other species. Using species by species data on catch, TAC and lease price for species under Individual Transferable Quotas, we evaluate the support for these hypotheses. The results suggest that rebuilding plans, under a strict timeline, ultimately created many of the choke species on the West Coast and reduced processing infrastructure, such that the fishery still struggles with low quota utilization even after stocks have been rebuilt. In comparison, the Gulf of Alaska has not had a history of rebuilding plans and generally has higher utilization. The results suggest that rebuilding plans intended to increase sustainable harvest have been successful at increasing abundance but have been unsuccessful at rebuilding the fishery.},

  abstract = {Shelled pteropods are widely regarded as bioindicators for ocean acidification, because their fragile aragonite shells are susceptible to increasing ocean acidity. While short-term incubations have demonstrated that pteropod calcification is negatively impacted by ocean acidification, we know little about net calcification in response to varying ocean conditions in natural populations. Here, we examine in situ calcification of Limacina helicina pteropods collected from the California Current Ecosystem, a coastal upwelling system with strong spatial gradients in ocean carbonate chemistry, dissolved oxygen and temperature. Depth-averaged pH ranged from 8.03 in warmer offshore waters to 7.77 in cold CO2-rich waters nearshore. Based on high-resolution micro-CT technology, we showed that shell thickness declined by\,\textasciitilde\,37\% along the upwelling gradient from offshore to nearshore water. Dissolution marks covered only\,\textasciitilde\,2\% of the shell surface area and were not associated with the observed variation in shell thickness. We thus infer that pteropods make thinner shells where upwelling brings more acidified and colder waters to the surface. Probably the thinner shells do not result from enhanced dissolution, but are due to a decline in calcification. Reduced calcification of pteropods is likely to have major ecological and biogeochemical implications for the cycling of calcium carbonate in the oceans.},

Both sets of trends suggest that the CCS can be divided into three distinct geographical regions, with transitions near Point Concepcion and Cape Mendocino. Long-term changes in SST in the CCS do not appear to be caused by local long-term changes in the wind stress in the same area. Common trends in SST are estimated for the CCS, for SST in the Peru–Chile Current System (PCCS), and for the two regions combined. Four common trends are needed to describe adequately the combined dynamics. The PCCS divides into similar regions as the CCS, and the loadings on the common trends of the regions in the CCS and PCCS are related for areas with similar dynamics, e.g. upwelling areas in the two regions load together. This suggests a more global process, rather than regional dynamics, may be underlying the climate variability in both these eastern boundary current regions. These results imply that climate change will affect geographically disparate ecosystems having a common physical and ecological structure in a like manner.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

The bulk catchability (Q), defined to be the ratio between swept-area biomass and actual biomass, is herein modeled using a Bayesian agestructured meta-analysis of suitable West Coast rockfish stocks. Six shelf stocks of rockfish were used. The posterior distribution of Q was insensitive to choice of prior and gives a probability of about 0.05 that the bulk catchability of a randomly selected shelf rockfish species will be unity or higher. Between survey variability in bulk catchabilities was modeled as a multiplicative main effect. With individual posterior probabilities in excess of 0.99, bulk catchabilities were lower than normal in 1977 and 1980 and higher than normal in 1989 and 1998. The low catchabilities in 1977 and 1980 are consistent with previously identified problems with lack of bottom contact in the earlier years of the survey. Future work will extend the model to incorporate dynamic modeling of unassessed rockfish stocks, and suggestions for this are given.},

As one proxy for ecosystem services and benefits, we quantified and mapped catch and economic value of California commercial fisheries removals using a 75-year spatially explicit time series. From 1931 to 2005, approximately 88\% of the catch was attributed to finfish. However, there has been an increasing reliance of proportional value from invertebrates over the last 25 years. The spatial organization of historical catches suggests species composition varies substantially by depth and latitude, and an evaluation of changes in the spatial distribution of catches in three different time periods suggests that spatial shifts in catch locations have occurred for some taxonomic groups over time. A spatial assessment of historical catches and value benefits marine spatial planning, informs stock assessments, provides a quantification of ecosystem services, and facilitates ecosystem-based approaches to marine fisheries management.},

Based on the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility of the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data, standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model fit. Comparison of trends among models suggests that the negative binomial regression model may overestimate model coefficients when fitted to data with many zero-valued observations.},

  abstract = {Nearly 300 species of Pleuronectiformes are found in the western Pacific, of which 120 species are recorded around Japan. In this area the geographical distribution of flatfish is generally related to family. Thus two major groupings are apparent; those from cold water, principally the major members of the Pleuronectidae, and those from warm-water habitats including members of the Citharidae, Paralichthyidae, Bothidae, Soleidae and Cynoglossidae. Notably, the family Scophthalmidae is not found in the northwestern Pacific. Japan's temperate location between subarctic and subtropical zones results in an overlap of the two groups. Most species inhabit the continental shelf, but some occupy waters deeper than 200 m and a few are found below 1000 m. Spawning occurs throughout the year at low latitudes, but tends to concentrate in summer at high latitudes. Flatfish tend to move to shallow water to spawn. Nursery grounds for juveniles are shallower than those of the spawning grounds. Size at metamorphosis and pelagic-life span vary among species, but there is a general trend of deeper-dwelling species having a longer pelagic life span and a larger size at metamorphosis. In general, flatfish do not exhibit large-scale migration, but most of them move to shallower waters in spring and return to deeper waters in autumn. Most species change their diet from zooplankton to benthic animals as they settle on the bottom. The Paralichthyidae mainly feed on mysids, the Pleuronectidae on polychaetes and the Soleidae on gammarids. There are significant differences in the ecology of flatfish between, and in some cases within, families. These differences make co-existence possible for the great number of flatfish species found on the continental shelf and slope in the northwestern Pacific.},

As the climate warms, westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere will strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters will warm, and sea ice will disappear. Moore et al. suggest that one effect of these changes will be a dramatic decrease in marine biological productivity (see the Perspective by Laufkötter and Gruber). This decrease will result from a global-scale redistribution of nutrients, with a net transfer to the deep ocean. By 2300, this could drive declines in fisheries yields by more than 20\% globally and by nearly 60\% in the North Atlantic. Science, this issue p. 1139; see also p. 1103 Climate change projections to the year 2100 may miss physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative effects of climate warming. In a coupled climate simulation to the year 2300, the westerly winds strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30°S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41\%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower–trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20\% globally and by nearly 60\% in the North Atlantic.

  abstract = {The conservation of deep-sea corals is of growing interest in the United States. A range of issues including biodiversity protection, conservation of seafloor habitats, and the role of deep-sea corals as essential fish habitat places greater significance on understanding the distributions of these corals and fishing activities. At the same time overfishing of some groundfish populations highlights the need for ecosystem-based management. Here we present records of habitat-forming deep-sea corals from the United States Pacific Fishery Management Council region that we analyze in relation to differential ecological impacts of demersal fishing gears. We use an ecological footprint approach combining groundfish catch by gear type with a previously published ecological severity ranking of fishing gears.Deep-sea corals in the Isididae, Paragorgiidae, Primnoidae, Antipathidae and Stylasteriidae families are widespread throughout their depth ranges in the Northeast Pacific, although the scleractinian families Oculinidae and Caryophylliidae are relatively rare. In this qualitative analysis, we highlight areas of relatively high coral concentration such as the West Coast continental shelf break and Monterey submarine canyon, areas that are presently relatively lightly fished but where corals are recorded. Bottom trawling gear has far and away the region’s largest ecological footprint. Other gears with smaller footprints include bottom longline, pot/trap and hook and line gear. Most of these impacts seem to have occurred in areas where deep-sea corals are relatively scarce, but fishing closures to protect rockfish implemented in 2002 may have the unfortunate effect of redistributing fishing effort to areas of deep-sea coral aggregations. An ecosystem-based management approach would detect and prevent such unintended consequences of redistributing fishing effort and placing deep-sea corals in harm’s way.},

  abstract = {The incidental capture, or bycatch, of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta in commercial fishing gear is considered a significant threat to their recovery. Bycatch analyses that use fishery-dependent data only reflect the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of turtles and fishing effort and therefore do not directly reveal conditions associated with turtle distributions. Fisheryindependent and -dependent data can be used together to identify environmental conditions associated with turtle presence and the subsequent risk of a bycatch encounter if fishing effort is present. We developed generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe fishery-independent encounter rates of loggerheads observed in aerial and resource surveys in the US mid-Atlantic region as a function of environmental variables. We then fit a fishery-independent GAM to fishery-dependent data collected from commercial gillnet, bottom trawl, and scallop dredge fisheries in the midAtlantic region, and tested the model on new fishery-dependent data to assess how well the model predicted bycatch events. The preferred model describes fishery-independent encounter rates as a function of latitude, sea-surface temperature, depth, and salinity. When this model was fit to fishery-dependent data and tested on new data, it predicted 85\% of the observed bycatch events when grouped by latitude and season, although it underestimated bycatch events in southern latitudes in winter. We identify times and areas of elevated bycatch risk on which to focus future conservation efforts and observer coverage.},

  abstract = {The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) 4-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation tool has been used to compute two sequences of circulation analyses for the U.S. west coast. One sequence of analyses spans the period 1980–2010 and is subject to surface forcing derived from relatively low resolution atmospheric products from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform wind product (CCMP) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis project. The second sequence spans the shorter period 1999–2012 and is subject to forcing derived from a high resolution product from the Naval Research Laboratory Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS). The two analysis periods are divided into eight day windows, and all available satellite observations of sea surface temperature and sea surface height, as well as in situ hydrographic profiles are assimilated into ROMS using 4D-Var. The performance of the system is monitored in terms of the cost function and the statistics of the innovations, and the impact of data assimilated on the circulation is assessed by comparing the posterior circulation estimates with the prior circulation and the circulation from a run of the model without data assimilation, with particular emphasis on eddy kinetic energy. This is part I of a two part series, and the circulation variability of the 4D-Var analyses will be documented in part II.},

  abstract = {The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), the dominant year-round pattern of monthly North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability, is an important target of ongoing research within the meteorological and climate dynamics communities and is central to the work of many geologists, ecologists, natural resource managers, and social scientists. Research over the last 15 years has led to an emerging consensus: the PDO is not a single phenomenon, but is instead the result of a combination of different physical processes, including both remote tropical forcing and local North Pacific atmosphere–ocean interactions, which operate on different time scales to drive similar PDO-like SST anomaly patterns. How these processes combine to generate the observed PDO evolution, including apparent regime shifts, is shown using simple autoregressive models of increasing spatial complexity. Simulations of recent climate in coupled GCMs are able to capture many aspects of the PDO, but do so based on a balance of processes often more independent of the tropics than is observed. Finally, it is suggested that the assessment of PDO-related regional climate impacts, reconstruction of PDO-related variability into the past with proxy records, and diagnosis of Pacific variability within coupled GCMs should all account for the effects of these different processes, which only partly represent the direct forcing of the atmosphere by North Pacific Ocean SSTs.},

We illustrate the inverse method using a simple bubble model that includes two end member types of bubbles: small bubbles that completely dissolve, and larger bubbles that briefly are submerged and exchange gases with seawater. An inverse solution to the oGCM constrains the flux contribution for bubbles that completely dissolve as a function of wind speed. Our results indicate air injection values at high wind speeds ({$>$} 10 m s−1) that fall between two previous estimates which differ by a factor of three. Future improvements of the method demonstrated here but including seasonality should allow for better constraints on bubble mediated gas exchange as well as the ability to test the performance of a range of bubble models.},

ΔKr/Ar, ΔN2/Ar, and δ40Ar were measured in deep profiles of samples collected in the northwest Pacific, subtropical North Pacific and tropical Atlantic oceans. For the ocean below 2000 m, we determined a mean ΔKr/Ar composition of −0.96\% ± 0.16\%, a mean ΔN2/Ar of 1.29\% ± 0.21\% relative to equilibrium saturation, and for δ40Ar a value of 1.188‰ ± 0.055‰ relative to air. These data are used to constrain high-latitude ventilation processes in the framework of three-box and seven-box ocean models. For the three-box model tracer data, we constrain the appropriate surface area of the high-latitude region in both models to be 3.6\% (+2.5\%, −1.7\%) of ocean surface area and the bubble air injection rate to be 22.7 (+8.8, −7.3) mol air m−2 yr−1. Results for the seven-box model were similar, with a high-latitude area of 3.3\% (+2.2\%, −1.3\%). Our results provide geochemical support for suggestions that the effective area of high-latitude ventilation is much smaller than the region of elevated preformed nutrients and demonstrate that noble gases strongly constrain the ocean solubility pump. Reducing high-latitude surface area weakens the CO2 solubility pump in the box models and limits communication between the atmosphere and deep ocean. These tracers should be useful constraints on high-latitude ventilation and the strength of the solubility pump in more complex ocean general circulation models.},

  abstract = {The effects of climate warming on ecosystem dynamics are widespread throughout the world's oceans. In the Northeast Pacific, large-scale climate patterns such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and recently unprecedented warm ocean conditions from 2014 to 2016, referred to as a marine heatwave (MHW), resulted in large-scale ecosystem changes. Larval fishes quickly respond to environmental variability and are sensitive indicators of ecosystem change. Categorizing ichthyoplankton dynamics across marine ecosystem in the Northeast Pacific can help elucidate the magnitude of assemblage shifts, and whether responses are synchronous or alternatively governed by local responses to regional oceanographic conditions. We analyzed time-series data of ichthyoplankton abundances from four ecoregions in the Northeast Pacific ranging from subarctic to subtropical: the Gulf of Alaska (1981–2017), British Columbia (2001–2017), Oregon (1998–2017), and the southern California Current (1981–2017). We assessed the impact of the recent (2014–2016) MHW and how ichthyoplankton assemblages responded to past major climate perturbations since 1981 in these ecosystems. Our results indicate that the MHW caused widespread changes in the ichthyoplankton fauna along the coast of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, but impacts differed between marine ecosystems. For example, abundances for most dominant taxa were at all-time lows since the beginning of sampling in the Gulf of Alaska and British Columbia, while in Oregon and the southern California Current species richness increased as did abundances of species associated with warmer waters. Lastly, species associated with cold waters also increased in abundances close to shore in southern California during the MHW, a pattern that was distinctly different from previous El Niño events. We also found several large-scale, synchronized ichthyoplankton assemblage composition shifts during past major climate events. Current climate projections suggest that MHWs will become more intense and thus our findings can help project future changes in larval dynamics, allowing for improved ecosystem management decisions.},

During EP El Niño winters, there are usually more warm days and warm nights, fewer frost days, cold days, and cold nights over the eastern and central United States than in winters with a CP El Niño, especially for the Ohio Valley, around the Great Lakes, and southern New England. For precipitation extremes, compared with CP El Niño, EP El Niño usually brings more extreme precipitation amounts, more days with large precipitation amounts, larger amounts of maximum consecutive 5-day total precipitation, and a shorter duration of consecutive dry days around the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. The 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies show that wave train patterns differ when the maximum tropical sea surface heating locations are displaced. The corresponding wind field and moisture convergence anomalies are examined to analyse the mechanisms that drive the anomaly fields associated with the two types of El Niño events.},

  abstract = {Climate may affect marine fish populations through many different pathways, operating at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Climate impacts may work their way bottom up through the food web or affect higher trophic levels more directly. In this review we try to disentangle and summarize some of the current knowledge made available through the rapidly increasing literature on the topic, with particular emphasis on the work within the Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC) programme. We first consider different classification schemes and hypotheses relating climate through physical features of the ocean to population patterns. The response of a population or community to climate may be linear or non-linear, direct or indirect. The hypotheses may be classified according to the form of physical features in operation as being related to mixing, advection or temperature. The bulk of the paper is devoted to a region-by-region presentation and discussion of examples relating climate variability to marine fish populations. It is slanted towards the North Atlantic and North Pacific, but the tropical Pacific is also covered. By means of different categorization methods we compare climate responses between ecosystems. We conclude that the use of such classification schemes allows for a more precise description of the various ecosystems particular properties and facilitates inter-regional comparison.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Effects of variation in spawning stock and sea temperature on long-term temporal patterns in recruitment dynamics of 38 commercially harvested fish stocks in the northern North Atlantic were studied. Different statistical models were explored within a Ricker stock-recruitment framework. This includes, in order of complexity, adding a linear temperature term, a nonlinear (smooth) temperature effect, and non-stationarities (trends in intercept or in temperature effect) and finally allowing for a stepwise change (a threshold). The different models were compared in a uniform approach using Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample size as the model selection criterion. The relationship between recruitment, spawning stock biomass and temperature varied over time. The most frequent alteration in the non-stationary linear models was, for 14 stocks, in the intercept in recruitment success, suggesting a change in pre-recruit mortality over time. Threshold models performed better than the best linear or nonlinear stationary models for 27 of the stocks, suggesting that abrupt changes (maybe even regime shifts) are common. For half of the stocks studied, the temperature effect was statistically significant when added to the model of the relationship between recruitment success and spawning stock biomass. This includes all 6 of the herring stocks studied, with a positive effect for cold-water stocks and negative effect for stocks in the more temperate southern areas. For the 4 plaice stocks analysed, all located towards the centre of the overall distribution range of plaice, a tendency toward recruitment being favoured by lower temperatures was found.}

  abstract = {An individual-based model (IBM) was used to investigate the effects of physical and biological variables on the transport via a jet current of anchovy (Engraulis capensis) eggs from spawning to the nursery grounds in the southern Benguela ecosystem. As transport of eggs and early larvae is considered to be one of the major factors impacting on anchovy recruitment success, this approach may be useful to understand further the recruitment variability in this economically and ecologically important species. By coupling the IBM to a 3D hydrodynamic model of the region called Plume, and by varying parameters such as the spatial and temporal location of spawning, particle buoyancy, and the depth range over which particles were released, we could assess the influences of these parameters on transport success. A sensitivity analysis using a General Linear Model identified the primary determinants of transport success in the various experimental simulations, and model outputs were examined and compared with patterns observed in field studies. Model outputs compared well with observed patterns of vertical and horizontal egg distribution. Particle buoyancy and area of particle release were the major single determinants of transport success, with an egg density of 1.025 g cm−3 maximizing average particle transport success and the western Agulhas Bank being the most successful spawning area. This IBM may be useful as a generic prototype for other upwelling ecosystems.},

Dover sole larvae (9-65 mm standard length) were collected in mid-water trawls and plankton nets during all months of the year. Judging from growth of larvae and occurrence in bottom trawls of recently metamorphosed juveniles, Dover sole are pelagic çluring their first year of life. Large larvae (50-65 mm standard length) are probably pelagic for over a year and few apparently are recruited to benthic populations. Dover sole larvae were most common in oceanic waters beyond the continental slope and in the upper 50 m of the water column. The rex sole larvae captured were 5-89 mm long. Average size and stage of development of larvae increased from March through February, and juveniles were common on the bottom during winter on the outer shelf. Thus the pelagic phase usually lasts about a year. Both rex and Dover sole may utilize the outer continental shelf-upper slope region for a nursery during early benthic life. Petrale sole larvae (10-22 mm standard length) were rare. They were collected only from March to June and appear to have a pelagic life of about 6 mo. Age-group Ojuveniles, uncommon in bottom trawl collections, were only captured on the inner continental shelf in the fall.},

Two species groups of nonschooling fishes were identified based on transects over the diverse seafloor habitats around the bank: one comprised primarily of rockfishes in shallow water on rock and cobble, and the other comprised of flatfishes, agonids, sablefish and some rockfishes in deep water over mud and cobble.

We used the gonadosomatic index to estimate instantaneous rates of natural mortality (M). Values of M differed little between species and areas despite substantial differences in temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Estimates for shortspines from both Alaska and the West Coast ranged between 0.013 and 0.017, while longspines from the West Coast showed an M value of 0.015.

This information is valuable input for modelling species interactions in the southern Benguela ecosystem. In the present study, a method is described for mapping the density distribution of 15 key species: anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax, round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis, lanternfish Lampanyctodes hectoris, lightfish Maurolicus muelleri, albacore Thunnus alalunga, bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus, snoek Thyrsites atun, Cape hake Merluccius spp., kingklip Genypterus capensis and chokka squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudi. The purpose was to make use of all available sources of data to extend the spatial and temporal coverage of the southern Benguela. Six sources of data were combined on a 10´ × 10´ cell grid in a Geographical Information System: acoustic and demersal surveys conducted by Marine and Coastal Management (MCM), and pelagic, demersal (including midwater trawl), hake-directed and tuna-directed longline commercial landings data collected by MCM. Comparisons of distributions between two periods (1980s and 1990s) and between two semesters (April –September and October–March) were conducted, but biases as a result of major differences in sampling strategy prevented detailed analysis for certain species. Maps of density distributions are nevertheless presented here and the method to determine them is discussed.Afr. J. mar. Sci. 26: 115–139},

  abstract = {Species mapping is an essential tool for conservation programmes as it provides clear pictures of the distribution of marine resources. However, in fishery ecology, the amount of objective scientific information is limited and data may not always be directly comparable. Information about the distribution of marine species can be derived from two main sources: fishery-independent data (scientific surveys at sea) and fishery-dependent data (collection and sampling by observers in commercial vessels). The aim of this paper is to compare whether these two different sources produce similar, complementary, or different results. We compare them in the specific context of identifying the Essential Fish Habitats of three elasmobranch species (S. canicula, G. melastomus, and E. spinax). Similarity and prediction statistics are used to compare the two different spatial patterns obtained by applying the same Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling approach in the two sources. Results showed that the spatial patterns obtained are similar, although differences are present. In particular, models based on fishery-dependent data are better able to identify temporal relationships between the probability of presence of the species and seasonal environmental variables. In contrast, fishery-independent data better discriminate spatial locations where a species is present or absent. Besides the spatial and temporal differences of the two datasets, the consistency of habitat results highlights the inclusion in each dataset of most of the environmental envelope of each species, both in time and space. Consequently, sampling data should be adapted to each species to reasonably cover their environmental envelope, and a combination of datasets will likely provide a better habitat estimation than using each dataset independently. These findings can be useful in helping fishery managers improve definition of survey design and analyses.},

  abstract = {In ecosystems that are strongly structured by predation, reducing top predator abundance can alter several lower trophic levels—a process known as a trophic cascade. A persistent trophic cascade also fits the definition of a regime shift. Such ‘trophic cascade regime shifts' have been reported in a few pelagic marine systems—notably the Black Sea, Baltic Sea and eastern Scotian Shelf—raising the question of how common this phenomenon is in the marine environment. We provide a general methodology for distinguishing top-down and bottom-up effects and apply this methodology to time series from these three ecosystems. We found evidence for top-down forcing in the Black Sea due primarily to gelatinous zooplankton. Changes in the Baltic Sea are primarily bottom-up, strongly structured by salinity, but top-down forcing related to changes in cod abundance also shapes the ecosystem. Changes in the eastern Scotian Shelf that were originally attributed to declines in groundfish are better explained by changes in stratification. Our review suggests that trophic cascade regime shifts are rare in open ocean ecosystems and that their likelihood increases as the residence time of water in the system increases. Our work challenges the assumption that negative correlation between consecutive trophic levels implies top-down forcing.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the occurrence, severity, and extent of hypoxia over the continental shelf of the northern California Current (40–48.5uN latitude) from 1998 to 2012. Clear seasonal trends exist in the timing and duration of hypoxia. The highest bottom-water dissolved oxygen concentrations occurred from November to March, and levels below the 1.4 mL L21 hypoxia threshold were detected during the upwelling season (May through October). Regions of hypoxia tended to occur north of 42uN latitude and were most severe over the widest areas of the continental shelf. Hypoxic waters covered up to 62\% (15,600 km2) of the continental shelf during some years (2002, 2007, 2008), and , 10\% in others (2003, 2010–2011). There are seasonal and interannual shifts in both the depth and oxygen content of upwelled waters. Years with the greatest extent and severity of hypoxia had the lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen in upwelling source waters. The dissolved oxygen concentration of source waters showed a gradual decline from 1998 through 2007, with a subsequent increase from 2008–2010 before leveling off in 2011 and 2012. The variability in oxygen content of source waters correlates well with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and may indicate the importance of large-scale climate dynamics in determining the extent and severity of hypoxia in the northern California Current.},

  abstract = {The eastern Bering Sea recently experienced an anomalously warm period followed by an anomalously cold period. These periods varied with respect to sea ice extent, water temperature, wind patterns, and ocean circulation. The distributions of Walleye Pollock early life stages also differed between periods, with larval stages found further eastward on the shelf in warm years. Statistical analyses indicated that these spatial distributions were more closely related to temperature than to other covariates, though a mechanism has not been identified. The objective of this study was to determine if variable transport could be driving the observed differences in pollock distributions. An individual-based model of pollock early life stages was developed by coupling a hydrodynamic model to a particle-tracking model with biology and behavior. Simulation experiments were performed with the model to investigate the effects of wind on transport, ice presence on time of spawning, and water temperature on location of spawning. This modeling approach benefited from the ability to individually test mechanisms to quantitatively assess the impact of each on the distribution of pollock. Neither interannual variability in advection nor advances or delays in spawning time could adequately represent the observed differences in distribution between warm and cold years. Changes to spawning areas, particularly spatial contractions of spawning areas in cold years, resulted in modeled distributions that were most similar to observations. The location of spawning pollock in reference to cross-shelf circulation patterns is important in determining the distribution of eggs and larvae, warranting further study on the relationship between spawning adults and the physical environment. The different distributions of pollock early life stages between warm and cold years may ultimately affect recruitment by influencing the spatial overlap of pollock juveniles with prey and predators.},

  abstract = {Many studies use sedimentary biogenic silica (bSiO2) stable isotopes (e.g., δ30Si) as paleoproxies but neglect signals from other sedimentary reactive SiO2 phases. We quantified δ30Si for multiple reactive Si pools in coastal river-plume sediments, revealing up to −5‰ difference between acid-leachable and alkaline-digestible amorphous SiO2. Thus, previous studies have missed valuable information on early diagenetic products and, in cases where sediments were not cleaned, potentially biased bSiO2 δ30Si values. Acid-leachable δ30Si, that is, from authigenic products, are the result of either multistep fractionation from a bSiO2 source or an 2‰ fractionation (consistent with metal hydroxide formation) from slowly dissolving lithogenic SiO2. This analysis also suggests that sedimentary diatom bSiO2, which has increased regionally in the last half-century, is the critical substrate of early authigenic Si precipitates. Regional eutrophication, which has stimulated sedimentary bSiO2 accumulation, may have facilitated additional sequestration of both sedimentary Si and cations from early diagenetic products.},

  abstract = {Impacts of bottom fishing, particularly trawling and dredging, on seabed (benthic) habitats are commonly perceived to pose serious environmental risks. Quantitative ecological risk assessment can be used to evaluate actual risks and to help guide the choice of management measures needed to meet sustainability objectives. We develop and apply a quantitative method for assessing the risks to benthic habitats by towed bottom-fishing gears. The method is based on a simple equation for relative benthic status (RBS), derived by solving the logistic population growth equation for the equilibrium state. Estimating RBS requires only maps of fishing intensity and habitat type – and parameters for impact and recovery rates, which may be taken from meta-analyses of multiple experimental studies of towed-gear impacts. The aggregate status of habitats in an assessed region is indicated by the distribution of RBS values for the region. The application of RBS is illustrated for a tropical shrimp-trawl fishery. The status of trawled habitats and their RBS value depend on impact rate (depletion per trawl), recovery rate and exposure to trawling. In the shrimp-trawl fishery region, gravel habitat was most sensitive, and though less exposed than sand or muddy-sand, was most affected overall (regional RBS = 91\% relative to un-trawled RBS = 100\%). Muddy-sand was less sensitive, and though relatively most exposed, was less affected overall (RBS = 95\%). Sand was most heavily trawled but least sensitive and least affected overall (RBS = 98\%). Region-wide, {$>$}94\% of habitat area had {$>$}80\% RBS because most trawling and impacts were confined to small areas. RBS was also applied to the region's benthic invertebrate communities with similar results. Conclusions. Unlike qualitative or categorical trait-based risk assessments, the RBS method provides a quantitative estimate of status relative to an unimpacted baseline, with minimal requirements for input data. It could be applied to bottom-contact fisheries world-wide, including situations where detailed data on characteristics of seabed habitats, or the abundance of seabed fauna are not available. The approach supports assessment against sustainability criteria and evaluation of alternative management strategies (e.g. closed areas, effort management, gear modifications).},

  abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen fixation by photosynthetic cyanobacteria (diazotrophs) strongly influences oceanic primary production and in turn affects global biogeochemical cycles. Species of the genus Trichodesmium are major contributors to marine diazotrophy, accounting for a significant proportion of the fixed nitrogen in tropical and subtropical oceans. However, Trichodesmium spp. are metabolically constrained by the availability of iron, an essential element for both the photosynthetic apparatus and the nitrogenase enzyme. Survival strategies in low-iron environments are typically poorly characterized at the molecular level, because these bacteria are recalcitrant to genetic manipulation. Here, we studied a homolog of the iron deficiency-induced A (IdiA)/ferric uptake transporter A (FutA) protein, Tery\_3377, which has been used as an in situ iron-stress biomarker. IdiA/FutA has an ambiguous function in cyanobacteria, with its homologs hypothesized to be involved in distinct processes depending on their cellular localization. Using signal sequence fusions to GFP and heterologous expression in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we show that Tery\_3377 is targeted to the periplasm by the twin-arginine translocase and can complement the deletion of the native Synechocystis ferric-iron ABC transporter periplasmic binding protein (FutA2). EPR spectroscopy revealed that purified recombinant Tery\_3377 has specificity for iron in the Fe3+ state, and an X-ray crystallography–determined structure uncovered a functional iron substrate–binding domain, with Fe3+ pentacoordinated by protein and buffer ligands. Our results support assignment of Tery\_3377 as a functional FutA subunit of an Fe3+ ABC transporter but do not rule out dual IdiA function.},

  abstract = {Marine renewable energy (MRE), though a relative newcomer to the ocean and coastal commons, has become a significant driver of marine spatial planning in the US, posing particular challenges to commercial fisheries and fishing communities. State and federal agencies with primary oversight for MRE development have focused on the identification of places where MRE might proceed unhindered by other uses, most notably coastal fisheries. These agencies and MRE developers have focused on potential space-use conflict and standard mitigation measures for loss of access to that space. However, discussions with fishery participants and other community members, as well as observations of processes on the US West and East Coasts, reveal a complex, multi-faceted social–ecological system not easily parsed out among users, nor amenable to classic mitigation formulas. Recent ethnographic research on potential space-use conflicts and mitigation for MRE demonstrates that marine space use is dynamic and multi-dimensional, with important linkages among fisheries, communities and other interests. Although experiences vary within and across regions and fishing communities, this research illustrates the weak position of fishing communities in marine spatial planning in the context of MRE development. This paper considers the implications of MRE for US East and West Coast fisheries and fishing communities situated within the larger context of neoliberalism and commodification of the ocean commons.},

  abstract = {Multiyear periods of relatively cold temperatures (2007–2013) and warm temperatures (2001–2005 and 2014–2018) altered the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem, affecting ocean currents and wind patterns, plankton community, and spatial distribution of fishes. Yellowfin sole Limanda aspera larvae were collected from the inner domain (≤50 m depth) of the eastern Bering Sea among four warm years (2002, 2004, 2005, 2016), an average year (2006), and three cold years (2007, 2010, 2012). Spatial distribution and density of larvae among those years was analyzed using generalized additive models that included timing of sea-ice retreat, areal coverage of water ≤0C, and water temperature as covariates. Analyses indicated a combination of temperature effects on the location and timing of spawning, and on egg and larval survival, may explain the variation in larval density and distribution among years. During warm years, higher density and wider spatial distribution of larvae may be due to earlier spawning, an expansion of the spawning area, and higher egg and larvae survival due to favorable temperatures. Larval distribution contracted shoreward, and density was lower during cold conditions and was likely due to fish spawning closer to shore to remain in preferred temperatures, later spawning, and increased mortality. Predicted drift trajectories from spawning areas showed that larvae would reach nursery grounds in most years. Years when the drift period was longer than the pelagic phase of the larvae occurred during both warm and cold conditions indicating that settlement outside of nursery areas could happen during either temperature condition.},

  abstract = {Changes in the abundance and productivity of biological populations in the North Pacific have often been associated with large-scale modes of climate variability. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which describes spatio-temporal variability in North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), correlates with much of this variability. However, since the late 1980s, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) has explained an increasing proportion of variance in North Pacific climate properties. Ecological responses to this change in the proportion of variance ascribed to the two climate patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that relationships between biological time series and climate covariates (SST and the PDO) differ for nine Gulf of Alaska fish and crustacean populations before and after the late 1980s. Additionally, we evaluate whether non-stationary climate-biology relationships arose synchronously across populations as a community response. We used different formulations of Generalized Additive Models in a population and community context and compared results to the classical approach of aggregated population responses based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results showed that climate-biology relationships weakened or reversed for most populations in the late 1980s, coinciding with the increase in variance of the NPGO. However, these non-stationary responses were highly species-specific and did not arise synchronously as a community response. We show that PCA does not represent community dynamics properly when only few species covary in time and exhibit long-term trends. Therefore, this approach might not be always useful to detect synchronous changes among biological time series as a community response. Novel associations among climate variables and novel climate-biology relationships are expected to become increasingly evident with future climate change, and the recognition of switches between different explanatory variable-response relationships may be critical for successful management of marine resources during transitions to these novel climate states.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, fisheries management advice has been based on stock assessments that considered merely the “best” set of assumptions while uncertainty arising only from observation and process error was quantified, if considered at all. Unfortunately, uncertainty attributable to lack of understanding of the true underlying system and to ineffective implementation may dominate the sources of error that must be accounted for if management is to be successful. The management procedure approach is advocated as the appropriate way to develop management advice for renewable resources. This approach, pioneered by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee, takes politically agreed management objectives and incorporates all scientific aspects of management including data collection and analysis, development of robust harvest control laws or effort regulations, and monitoring. A primary feature is that uncertainty (including that arising from sources conventionally ignored) is taken into account explicitly through population simulations for a variety of scenarios. The nature of the management procedures developed for commercial and aboriginal subsistence whaling and the processes by which they have been developed is highlighted. We also identify lessons that have been learned from two decades of IWC experience and suggest how these can be applied to other fishery situations.},

In fisheries management and assessment, fish stocks are the fundamental biological unit, but the reasoning for the operational management unit is often indistinct and mismatches between the biology and the management action frequently occur. Despite the plethora of population genetic data on marine fishes, to date little or no use is made of the information, despite the fact that the detection of genetic differentiation may indicate reproductively distinct populations. Here, we discuss key aspects of genetic population differentiation in the context of their importance for fisheries management. Furthermore, we evaluate the population structure of all 32 managed marine fish species in the north-east Atlantic and relate this structure to current management units and practice. Although a large number of studies on genetic population structure have been published in the last decades, data are still rare for most exploited species. The mismatch between genetic population structure and the current management units found for six species (Gadus morhua, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Merlangius merlangus, Micromesistius poutassou, Merluccius merluccius and Clupea harengus), emphasizes the need for a revision of these units and questions the appropriateness of current management measures. The implementation of complex and dynamic population structures into novel and less static management procedures should be a primary task for future fisheries management approaches.},

Euphausiid patches were clustered inshore of Heceta Bank (44.0°N) and off Cape Blanco (42.8°N), but were not common elsewhere. The distribution of euphausiid patches throughout the study area was correlated with that of near-surface chlorophyll. We suggest that Heceta Bank and Cape Blanco were zones of plankton retention and concentration along the shelf and slope, and also that large offshore meanders in the equatorward upwelling jet carried upwelled water, chlorophyll, and euphausiids offshore. In particular, the complex interaction of mesoscale physical features, shoaling bottom topography, and diel vertical migration created large patches of euphausiids. These euphausiid patches, probably persisting on timescales of days to weeks, could function as relatively large and persistent resources for euphausiid predators.},

  abstract = {Single species distribution models (SSDMs) are typically used to understand and predict the distribution and abundance of marine fish by fitting distribution models for each species independently to a combination of abiotic environmental variables. However, species abundances and distributions are influenced by abiotic environmental preferences as well as biotic dependencies such as interspecific competition and predation. When species interact, a joint species distribution model (JSDM) will allow for valid inference of environmental effects. We built a joint species distribution model of marine fish and invertebrates of the Northeast US Continental Shelf, providing evidence on species relationships with the environment as well as the likelihood of species to covary. Predictive performance is similar to SSDMs but the Bayesian joint modeling approach provides two main advantages over single species modeling: (1) the JSDM directly estimates the significance of environmental effects; and (2) predicted species richness accounts for species dependencies. An additional value of JSDMs is that the conditional prediction of species distributions can use not only the environmental associations of species, but also the presence and abundance of other species when forecasting future climatic associations.},

  abstract = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) have been used to address a wide range of theoretical and applied questions in the terrestrial realm, but marine-based applications remain relatively scarce. In this review, we consider how conceptual and practical issues associated with terrestrial SDMs apply to a range of marine organisms and highlight the challenges relevant to improving marine SDMs. Location We include studies from both marine and terrestrial systems that encompass many geographic locations around the globe. Methods We first performed a literature search and analysis of marine and terrestrial SDMs in ISI Web of Science to assess trends and applications. Using knowledge from terrestrial applications, we critically evaluate the application of SDMs in marine systems in the context of ecological factors (dispersal, species interactions, aggregation and ontogenetic shifts) and practical considerations (data quality, alternative modelling approaches and model validation) that facilitate or create difficulties for model application. Results The relative importance of ecological factors to be considered when applying SDMs varies among terrestrial and marine organisms. Correctly incorporating dispersal is frequently considered an important issue for terrestrial models, but because there is greater potential for dispersal in the ocean, it is often less of a concern in marine SDMs. By contrast, ontogenetic shifts and feeding have received little attention in terrestrial SDM applications, but these factors are important to many marine SDMs. Opportunities also exist for applying more advanced SDM approaches in the marine realm, including mechanistic ecophysiological models, where water balance and heat transfer equations are simpler for some marine organisms relative to their terrestrial counterparts. Main conclusions SDMs have generally been under-utilized in the marine realm relative to terrestrial applications. Correlative SDM methods should be tested on a range of marine organisms, and we suggest further development of methods that address ontogenetic shifts and feeding interactions. We anticipate developments in, and cross-fertilization between, coupled correlative and process-based SDMs, mechanistic eco-physiological SDMs, and spatial population dynamic models for climate change and species invasion applications in particular. Comparisons of the outputs of different model types will provide insight that is useful for improved spatial management of marine species.},

  abstract = {There is mounting evidence to suggest that many species are shifting their ranges in concordance with the climate velocity of their preferred environmental conditions/habitat. While accelerated rates in species’ range shifts have been noted in areas of intense warming, due to climate change, few studies have considered the influence that both spatial temperature gradients and rates of warming (i.e., the two components of climate velocity) could have on rates of movement in species habitats. We compared projected shifts in the core habitat of nine large pelagic fish species (five tuna, two billfish and two shark species) off the east coast of Australia at different spatial points (centre, leading and trailing edges of the core habitat), during different seasons (summer and winter), in the near-(2030) and long-term (2070), using independent species distribution models and habitat suitability models. Model projections incorporated depth integrated temperature data from 11 climate models with a focus on the IPCC SRES A2 general emission scenario. Projections showed a number of consistent patterns: southern (poleward) shifts in all species’ core habitats; trailing edges shifted faster than leading edges; shifts were faster by 2070 than 2030; and there was little difference in shifts among species and between seasons. Averaging across all species and climate models, rates of habitat shifts for 2030 were 45–60 km decadeÀ1 at the trailing edge, 40–45 km decadeÀ1 at the centre, and 20–30 km decadeÀ1 at the leading edge. Habitat shifts for 2070 were 60–70 km decadeÀ1 at the trailing edge, 50–55 km decadeÀ1 at the centre, and 30–40 km decadeÀ1 at the leading edge. It is often assumed that the leading edge of a species range will shift faster than the trailing edge, but there are few projections or observations in large pelagic fish to validate this assumption. We found that projected shifts at the trailing edge were greater than at the centre and leading of core habitats in all large pelagic fish included in our study. Faster shifts at species trailing edges were due to weaker spatial gradients in temperature in the north than in the south of the study region, in conjunction with relatively constant rates of warming across latitudes. Rather than assuming that leading edges will always move faster, this study suggests that spatial gradients of temperature could be important in determining differences in shifts at different points in species core habitats.},

These ecological impacts of climate change will affect human communities dependent on fisheries for livelihoods and well-being3. While methods for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change are rapidly developing4 and socio-ecological vulnerability assessments for fisheries are becoming available5, there has been less work devoted to understanding how impacts differ across fishing communities. We developed a linked socio-ecological approach to assess the exposure of fishing communities to risk from climate change, and present a case study of New England and Mid-Atlantic (USA) fishing communities. We found that the northern part of the study region was projected to gain suitable habitat and the southern part projected to lose suitable habitat for many species, but the exposure of fishing communities to risk was strongly dependent on both their spatial use of the ocean and their portfolio of species caught. A majority of fishing communities were projected to face declining future fishing opportunities unless they adapt, either through catching new species or fishing in new locations. By integrating climatic, ecological and socio-economic data at a scale relevant to fishing communities, this analysis identifies where strategies for adapting to the ecological impacts of climate change will be most needed.},

  abstract = {Climate-related distribution shifts for marine species are, in general, amplified in northern latitudes. The objective of this study was to predict future distributions of commercially important species in the eastern Bering Sea under six climate scenarios, by incorporating predictions of future oceanographic conditions. We used species distribution modelling to determine potential distribution changes in four time periods (2013–2017, 2030–2039, 2060–2069, and 2090-2099) relative to 1982–2012 for 16 marine fish and invertebrates. Most species were predicted to have significant shifts in the centre of gravity of the predicted abundance, the area occupied, and the proportion of the predicted abundance found in the standard bottom trawl survey area. On average the shifts were modest, averaging 35.2\,km (ranging from 1 to 202\,km). There were significant differences in the predicted trend for distribution metrics among climate scenarios, with the most extensive changes in distribution resulting from Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate scenarios. The variability in distributional shifts among years and climate scenarios was high, although the magnitudes were low. This study provides a basis for understanding where fish populations might expand or contract in future years. This will provide managers’ information that can help guide appropriate actions under warming conditions.},

Community size spectra, the distributions of community biomass over the logarithmic body-mass axis, tend to exhibit regularly spaced local maxima, called “domes”, separated by steep troughs. Contrasting established theory, we explain these dome patterns as manifestations of top-down trophic cascades along aquatic food chains. Compiling high quality size-spectrum data and comparing these with a size-spectrum model introduced in this study, we test this theory and develop a detailed picture of the mechanisms by which bottom-up and top-down effects interact to generate dome patterns. Results imply that strong top-down trophic cascades are common in freshwater communities, much more than hitherto demonstrated, and may arise in nutrient rich marine systems as well. Transferring insights from the general theory of non-linear pattern formation to domes patterns, we provide new interpretations of past lake-manipulation experiments.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and assessment of natural resources often require inputs from multiple data sources. In fisheries science, for example, the inference of a species’ abundance distribution relies on two main data sources, namely commercial fisheries and scientific survey data. Despite efforts to combine these data into an integrated statistical model, their coupling is frequently hampered due to differences in their sampling designs, which imposes distinct bias sources in the estimator of the abundance distribution. We developed a flexible species distribution model (SDM) that can integrate both data sources while filtering out their relative bias contributions. We applied the model on three different age groups of the western Baltic cod stock. For each age group, we tested the model on (1) survey data and (2) integrated data (survey + commercial) as a means to compare their differences and investigate how the inclusion of commercial fisheries data improved the spatiotemporal abundance estimator and parameter estimates. Moreover, we proposed a novel validation approach to evaluate whether the inclusion of commercial fisheries data in the integrated model is not in direct contradiction with the survey data. Following our approach, the results indicated that the use of commercial fisheries data is suitable for the integrated model. Across all age groups, our results demonstrated how commercial fisheries supplied additional information on cod’s spatiotemporal abundance dynamics, highlighting sometimes abundance hot spots that were not detected by the survey model alone. Additionally, the integrated model provided a reduction of up to 20\% and 10\% in the uncertainty (SE) of the predicted abundance fields and fixed-effect parameters, respectively. The proposed model represents thus a valuable benchmark for evaluating spatiotemporal dynamics of fish, and strengthens the science-based advice for marine policymakers.},

  abstract = {Trawls harness the innate avoidance behavior of fish to affect their capture. As such, effective bycatch reduction relies, in part, upon knowledge of behavioral differences between target and non-target species. The behavior of flatfish during herding, net entry and passage through trawls differs substantially from that of many roundfish. These differences result from the unique body morphology of flatfish and the constraints this morphology places upon their natural predator avoidance and evasion tactics. Paramount, in this regard, is the intimate association between flatfish and the seafloor. Flatfish utilize a detection minimization strategy that combines burial, highly evolved cryptic capabilities and low activity. Additionally, the maximum sustained swimming speeds and endurance of flatfishes are low compared to most roundfish. As a result, flatfish typically respond to trawl ground-gear at shorter distances, remain closer to the seafloor during herding and herd in the net mouth for a shorter time, prior to net entry, than roundfish. As is the case for roundfish species, light and temperature influence flatfish reactivity and herding behavior. At low ambient light levels herding behavior in flatfish breaks down, as fish initially respond to ground-gear by rising off the bottom, which removes them from the ground-gear's zone of influence. Similarly, at low temperatures some flatfish display reduced herding. Differences in behavior between flatfish and roundfish have spurred development of selective flatfish trawls, with low rise head ropes and/or open or large mesh intermediates that allow rising roundfish to exit the net opening, while flatfish remain close to the net floor, passing into the net and back to the codend. Lastly, a conceptual design for a counter-herding device is presented, which takes advantage of the longer reactive distances of roundfish, and their tendency to herd farther of the seafloor, thereby allowing them to be herded out of the path of the net, while not influencing the normal inward herding of flatfish.},

  abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment of projected global and regional ocean temperature change is based on global climate models that have coarse (∼100 km) ocean and atmosphere resolutions. In the Northwest Atlantic, the ensemble of global climate models has a warm bias in sea surface temperature due to a misrepresentation of the Gulf Stream position; thus, existing climate change projections are based on unrealistic regional ocean circulation. Here we compare simulations and an atmospheric CO2 doubling response from four global climate models of varying ocean and atmosphere resolution. We find that the highest resolution climate model (∼10 km ocean, ∼50 km atmosphere) resolves Northwest Atlantic circulation and water mass distribution most accurately. The CO2 doubling response from this model shows that upper-ocean (0–300 m) temperature in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf warms at a rate nearly twice as fast as the coarser models and nearly three times faster than the global average. This enhanced warming is accompanied by an increase in salinity due to a change in water mass distribution that is related to a retreat of the Labrador Current and a northerly shift of the Gulf Stream. Both observations and the climate model demonstrate a robust relationship between a weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and an increase in the proportion of Warm-Temperate Slope Water entering the Northwest Atlantic Shelf. Therefore, prior climate change projections for the Northwest Atlantic may be far too conservative. These results point to the need to improve simulations of basin and regional-scale ocean circulation.},

  abstract = {A profound warming event in the Gulf of Maine during the last decade has caused sea surface temperatures to rise to levels exceeding any earlier observations recorded in the region over the last 150~years. This event dramatically affected CO2 solubility and, in turn, the status of the sea surface carbonate system. When combined with the concomitant increase in sea surface salinity and assumed rapid equilibration of carbon dioxide across the air sea interface, thermodynamic forcing partially mitigated the effects of ocean acidification for pH, while raising the saturation index of aragonite (\$\$\textbackslash varOmega\_\{AR\}\$\$ΩAR) by an average of 0.14~U. Although the recent event is categorically extreme, we find that carbonate system parameters also respond to interannual and decadal variability in temperature and salinity, and that such phenomena can mask the expression of ocean acidification caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. An analysis of a 34-year salinity and SST time series (1981–2014) shows instances of 5–10~years anomalies in temperature and salinity that perturb the carbonate system to an extent greater than that expected from ocean acidification. Because such conditions are not uncommon in our time series, it is critical to understand processes controlling the carbonate system and how ecosystems with calcifying organisms respond to its rapidly changing conditions. It is also imperative that regional and global models used to estimate carbonate system trends carefully resolve variations in the physical processes that control CO2 concentrations in the surface ocean on timescales from episodic events to decades and longer.},

  abstract = {Self-reporting of information is an inexpensive means for collecting data on fishing or other human activities, but the accuracy of self-reported data can be difficult to measure. Logbooks that record fishing activities are a common form of self-reporting that can provide vast amounts of information about a fishery. Using logbook data from trawlers from Oregon ports operating along the US Pacific coast during 1987–2001, this study examined (a) the consistency of reported tow locations and bottom depths and (b) the accuracy of reported retained catches of four groundfish species groups. Because logbook data during this period played no direct role in fishery management or stock assessments, there were no obvious incentives for trawl captains to deliberately report false logbook information. To evaluate consistency between tow locations and corresponding bottom depths, each tow was assigned to a 100m bottom depth-band based on the reported tow location on a digital chart. The depth-bands based on the tow locations were then compared one-to-one with the depths reported in the logbooks and analysed to determine factors (e.g., year, quarter, vessel) contributing to the consistency between the reported locations and depths. Consistency was highest in the shallowest depth-bands and there was a strong interaction between depth and vessel. To evaluate the accuracy of the retained catches reported by the captains, the tow-by-tow logbook data were summed to the fishing-trip-level and compared to the official landing weights, recorded at the fish processing plants when the catches were off-loaded and weighed. The logbook weights relative to the corresponding official landing weights were analysed using zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression models to determine factors (year, quarter, vessel) that were important explanatory variables. The analysis found strong year, quarter, and vessel effects for all three parts of the ZIGP: the mean value, the dispersion, and the proportion of zeros. The vessel effect was strongest. In a combined analysis, based on results from the other two analyses, vessels that were consistent in recording their depths and fishing locations had only a weak tendency to be accurate in recording their catches.},

The model is applied to thirteen years of data from seven fisheries of the lebranche mullet (Mugil liza) southern population, distributed along the southern and southeastern shelf regions of Brazil. The results indicate that this modelling strategy is useful and has room for extensions. There are reasons for concern about the sustainability of the mullet stock, although the wide posterior credibility intervals for key reference points preclude conclusive statistical evidence at this time.},

  abstract = {Studies of predator–prey demographic responses and the physical drivers of such relationships are rare, yet essential for predicting future changes in the structure and dynamics of marine ecosystems. Here, we hypothesize that predator–prey relationships vary spatially in association with underlying physical ocean conditions, leading to observable changes in demographic rates, such as reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we quantified spatio-temporal variability in hydrographic conditions, krill, and forage fish to model predator (seabird) demographic responses over 18 years (1990–2007). We used principal component analysis and spatial correlation maps to assess coherence among ocean conditions, krill, and forage fish, and generalized additive models to quantify interannual variability in seabird breeding success relative to prey abundance. The first principal component of four hydrographic measurements yielded an index that partitioned ‘‘warm/weak upwelling’’ and ‘‘cool/strong upwelling’’ years. Partitioning of krill and forage fish time series among shelf and oceanic regions yielded spatially explicit indicators of prey availability. Krill abundance within the oceanic region was remarkably consistent between years, whereas krill over the shelf showed marked interannual fluctuations in relation to ocean conditions. Anchovy abundance varied on the shelf, and was greater in years of strong stratification, weak upwelling and warmer temperatures. Spatio-temporal variability of juvenile forage fish co-varied strongly with each other and with krill, but was weakly correlated with hydrographic conditions. Demographic responses between seabirds and prey availability revealed spatially variable associations indicative of the dynamic nature of ‘‘predator–habitat’’ relationships. Quantification of spatially explicit demographic responses, and their variability through time, demonstrate the possibility of delineating specific critical areas where the implementation of protective measures could maintain functions and productivity of central place foraging predators.},

We examine socio-ecological features of the unprecedented 2014–2016 northeast Pacific marine heatwave to understand the potential causes for record numbers of whale entanglements in the central California Current crab fishery. We observed habitat compression of coastal upwelling, changes in availability of forage species (krill and anchovy), and shoreward distribution shift of foraging whales. We propose that these ecosystem changes, combined with recovering whale populations, contributed to the exacerbation of entanglements throughout the marine heatwave. In 2016, domoic acid contamination prompted an unprecedented delay in the opening of California’s Dungeness crab fishery that inadvertently intensified the spatial overlap between whales and crab fishery gear. We present a retroactive assessment of entanglements to demonstrate that cooperation of fishers, resource managers, and scientists could mitigate future entanglement risk by developing climate-ready fisheries approaches, while supporting thriving fishing communities.},

  abstract = {Massive use of beaches has forced traditional management of these systems to focus on the service offer to users. Consequently, human activity and behavior prevailed over other biological and physical processes and functions. Mirroring this tendency, the use of Performance Awards (Blue Flag) and Environmental/Quality Management Systems (ISO 14001, EMAS, and Q of Quality) were popularized as standards of environmental quality. In parallel to this process, recent international coastal and marine policies have emphasized the need to develop sustainable strategies for implementing the principles of the Ecosystem Approach into management with the overarching goal to maintain ecosystem integrity while enabling the sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services in systems under management. As Performance Awards and Environmental/Quality Management Systems do not follow the Ecosystem Approach, an Ecosystem-Based Management System for beaches (EBMS-Beaches) is introduced to overcome this issue. The EBMS-Beaches is intended as a formal standard framework that add new aspects not considered in a classical beach management process by the introduction of the principles of the Ecosystem Approach, between them: a) a clear vision-driven process; b) a holistic approach from a geographical perspective; c) pressure analysis and institutional coordination inside clear participatory planning; d) use of risk management techniques in planning; e) the ecosystem service concept as the central piece of the system; f) use of the DPSWR as accountable framework of indicators, g) desired vision based on state indicators and using BQI partial indices; and h) timely participation by local population. The EBMS is structured along three pillars (managerial, informative and participatory pillars) working in an adaptive management way. Based on these three pillars, existing management practices can be standardized into a viable, systematic means of implementing, in an integrated way, the new international policies for beach social-ecological systems. An initial experience of EBMS implementation in a particular beach (S'Abanell beach, Girona-Catalonia, Northwestern Mediterranean) has been initiated and it is presented.},

  abstract = {Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) supports substantial fisheries in both the eastern and western Pacific Oceans. Juvenile recruitment along the west coast of the continental United States has been highly variable over the past three decades. Using a generalized additive model, we demonstrate that physical oceanographic variables within the California Current System have significant effects on sablefish recruitment. Significant relationships were found between juvenile recruitment and northward Ekman transport, eastward Ekman transport, and sea level during key times and at key locations within the habitat of this species. The model explains nearly 70\% of the variability in sablefish recruitment between the years 1974 and 2000. The predictive power of the model was demonstrated by refitting without the last 5 yr of data and subsequent prediction of those years. Bootstrap assessments of bias associated with parameter estimates and jackknife-after-bootstrap assessments of the influence of individual data on parameter estimates are presented and discussed. Using this model, it is possible to draw preliminary conclusions concerning year-class strength of cohorts not yet available to the survey gear as well as historic year-class strengths. We discuss changes in zooplankton abundance and shifts in species of copepods associated with fluctuations in the physical variables that appear to have a major influence on sablefish recruitment.},

Variations on two methods of incorporating environmental effects were tested. The first method (“model” method) utilizes a structural change in the stock–recruitment function to adjust the annual expected number of recruits by a value, either positive or negative, equal to that year's anomaly in the environmental variable. The second method (“data” method) allows for observation error in the environmental data and uses the time-series as an index to tune the vector of estimates of annual recruitment deviations. Simulation techniques were utilized to produce datasets of known quantities that were subsequently analysed with a widely used stock assessment platform. Under the circumstances simulated in this study, neither method could be said to have performed significantly better than the other in all situations. Because the two approaches handle years of missing data differently, the best approach is dictated by the available data, rather than a more appropriate method.},

  abstract = {Elucidating connections between ocean climate variability and change and recruitment of juvenile fishes to adult populations is critical for understanding variability in stock–recruit dynamics. Recruitment to adult rockfish populations in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) is highly variable, leading to short- and long-term changes in abundance, productivity, forage availability, and potential fisheries yield. We used regional ocean model output, oceanographic data, and a 34-year time series of pelagic juvenile rockfish to investigate the interaction between changes in CCE source waters, as reflected by physical water mass properties, and recruitment variability. Specifically, variability of “spiciness” on upper water isopycnals explains a substantial fraction of the variation in pelagic juvenile rockfish abundance. High rockfish abundances correspond to cooler, fresher waters with higher dissolved oxygen (i.e., “minty”) conditions, indicative of Pacific subarctic water. By contrast, years of low rockfish abundance are associated with warmer, more saline, and more oxygen-deficient (i.e., “spicy”) conditions, reflecting waters of subtropical or equatorial origin. Transport and source waters in the CCE are key factors determining densityindependent processes and subsequent recruitment to adult populations.},

  abstract = {The role that west coast estuarine habitats play in the early life history of many nearshore marine fishes is poorly understood, in part due to the limited temporal sampling of estuarine habitats. To begin to understand this role, we compared the juvenile demersal fish community between two habitat types at a marine-dominated estuary on the northeast Pacific coast and examined how community structure changed temporally. Sampling occurred in Yaquina Bay, Oregon during 2008–2009, 2012–2013, and 2016–2017\,at eleven sites, comprised of anthropogenic (dock) and natural (eelgrass) habitats. The juvenile fish assemblage was dominated by a few highly abundant species, including saddleback gunnel (Pholis ornata), Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus), and rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), with the majority of species being marine associated. Community structure varied among years and between habitat types, with greater differences seen between habitat types than years. Docks appear to be a specialized habitat, supporting some species but with greater change in community structure over time and lower overall abundances than eelgrass. Use of docks by commercially and recreationally-exploited species, though, indicates potential importance. Community structure differences were best described by a combination of regional (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and local (upwelling, temperature, salinity) climate variables, but correlation values are considered weak. Greater abundances and reduced change in communities over time at eelgrass sites suggests that maintaining these habitats is potentially critical for many estuary-rearing species, and temporal changes in these communities highlight the importance of long-term monitoring.},

  abstract = {Asymmetries in responses to climate change have the potential to alter important predator–prey interactions, in part by altering the location and size of spatial refugia for prey. We evaluated the effect of ocean warming on interactions between four important piscivores and four of their prey in the U.S. Northeast Shelf by examining species overlap under historical conditions (1968–2014) and with a doubling in CO2. Because both predator and prey shift their distributions in response to changing ocean conditions, the net impact of warming or cooling on predator–prey interactions was not determined a priori from the range extent of either predator or prey alone. For Atlantic cod, an historically dominant piscivore in the region, we found that both historical and future warming led to a decline in the proportion of prey species’ range it occupied and caused a potential reduction in its ability to exert top-down control on these prey. In contrast, the potential for overlap of spiny dogfish with prey species was enhanced by warming, expanding their importance as predators in this system. In sum, the decline in the ecological role for cod that began with overfishing in this ecosystem will likely be exacerbated by warming, but this loss may be counteracted by the rise in dominance of other piscivores with contrasting thermal preferences. Functional diversity in thermal affinity within the piscivore guild may therefore buffer against the impact of warming on marine ecosystems, suggesting a novel mechanism by which diversity confers resilience.},

Here, we examined trends in the distribution and biomass of five commercial target species (dover sole, thornyheads, sablefish, lingcod, and petrale sole) on the US west coast to determine how their availability to fishing ports changed over 40\,years. We show that the timing and magnitude of stock declines and recoveries are not experienced uniformly along the coast when they coincide with shifts in species distributions. For example, overall stock availability of sablefish was more stable in southern latitudes where a 40\% regional decline in biomass was counterbalanced by a southward shift in distribution of \&gt;200\,km since 2003. Greater vessel mobility and larger areal extent of fish habitat along the continental shelf buffered northerly ports from latitudinal changes in stock availability. Landings were not consistently related to stock availability, suggesting that social, economic, and regulatory factors likely constrain or facilitate the capacity for fishers to adapt to changes in fish availability. Coupled social–ecological analyses such as the one presented here are important for defining community vulnerability to current and future changes in the availability of important marine species.},

  abstract = {The Intermittent Upwelling Hypothesis (IUH) posits that subsidies of larvae and phytoplankton to intertidal communities should vary unimodally along a gradient of upwelling from persistent upwelling to persistent downwelling with most subsidies occurring where upwelling is of intermediate strength and intermittent. Furthermore, the hypothesis states that larvae and phytoplankton are transported far offshore by strong, persistent upwelling and fail to subsidize nearshore communities, whereas weak upwelling or downwelling reduces nutrients for phytoplankton production limiting food for larvae and nearshore communities. We review studies conducted at sea and onshore and reanalyze published data to test the IUH and evaluate alternative hypotheses. To test the hypothesis, we examine five predictions that must hold if the IUH is true. (1) Larvae should inhabit the surface Ekman layer where they are transported offshore during upwelling. Larvae of many intertidal taxa occur deeper in the water column where currents flow shoreward during upwelling. (2) Larvae of nearshore species should occur farther offshore during upwelling than during relaxation or downwelling. Larvae of many nearshore species remain within several kilometers of shore during both conditions. (3) Larval settlement in intertidal communities should be lower during upwelling than relaxation or downwelling. Daily larval settlement has not observed to be higher during relaxation or downwelling events; settlement has most often been seen to vary with the fortnightly tidal cycle likely due to onshore larval transport by internal tides. (4) Larval settlement and recruitment in intertidal communities should be lower in areas of strong, persistent upwelling than where upwelling is weaker and less persistent. Recruitment of mussels and barnacles to artificial and natural substrates did not vary with the strength of upwelling, but did vary inversely with two measures of desiccation potential, and directly with indicators of surf zone hydrodynamics; larval recruitment was higher where surf zones were more dissipative with rip currents. (5) Phytoplankton subsidies to nearshore communities should be highest where upwelling is moderate and intermittent. Like larval subsidies, phytoplankton subsidies varied spatially with surf zone hydrodynamics rather than upwelling. This reconsideration of the evidence for the IUH finds the hypothesis unsupported.},

Classical, stratified abundance estimators provide unbiased estimates of abundance, but such estimators may be imprecise and impede assessment of population status and trend when the distribution of individuals is highly variable in space. Model-based procedures that account for important environmental covariates can improve overall precision, but frequently there is uncertainty about the contribution of particular environmental variables and a lack of information about variables that are important determinants of abundance. We develop a general semiparametric mixture model that incorporates measured habitat variables and a nonparametric smoothing term to account for unmeasured variables. We contrast this spatial habitat approach with two stratified abundance estimators and compare the three models using an intensively managed marine fish, darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri). We show that the spatial habitat model yields more precise, biologically reasonable, and interpretable estimates of abundance than the classical methods. Our results suggest that while design-based estimators are unbiased, they may exaggerate temporal variability of populations and strongly influence inference about population trend. Furthermore, when such estimates are used in broader meta-analyses, such imprecision may affect the broader biological inference (e.g., the causes and consequences of the variability of populations).},

Various cyanobacterial groups have traditionally been considered the major oceanic diazotrophs, but later noncyanobacterial and presumably heterotrophic diazotrophs were also found to be widespread and potentially important in nitrogen fixation. However, the distribution and activity of different diazotroph groups is still poorly constrained for most oceanic ecosystems. Here we examined diazotroph community structure and activity along a 7500 km south-north transect between the central equatorial Pacific and the Bering Sea. Nitrogen fixation contributed up to 84\% of new production in the upper waters of the subtropical gyre, where the diazotroph community included the gammaproteobacterium γ-24774A11 and highly active cyanobacterial phylotypes ({$>$}50\% of total nifH transcript abundance). Nitrogen fixation was sometimes detectable down to 150 m depth and extended horizontally to the edge of the gyre at around 35°N. Nitrogen fixation was even detected far north on the Bering Sea shelf. In the Alaskan Coastal Waters on the Bering Sea shelf, low nitrate together with high dissolved iron concentrations seemed to foster diazotroph growth, including a prominent role of UCYN-A2, which was abundant near the surface (1.2×105 nifH gene copies L−1). Our study provides evidence for nitrogen fixation in the Bering Sea and suggests a clear contrast in the composition of diazotrophs between the tropical/subtropical gyre and the separate waters in the cold northern regions of the North Pacific.},

Using a regional model extending from 43°N to 50°N, with an oxygen component developed in this study, drivers of seasonal and regional oxygen variability are identified. The model includes two pools of detritus, which was an essential addition in order to achieve good agreement with the observations. The model was validated using an extensive array of hydrographic and moored observations. The model captures the observed seasonal decline as well as spatial trends in bottom oxygen. Spatially, three regions of high respiration are identified as locations where hypoxia develops each modeled year. Two of the regions are previously identified recirculation regions. The third region is off of the Washington coast. Sediment oxygen demand causes the region on the Washington coast to be susceptible to hypoxia and is correlated to the broad area of shallow shelf ({$<$}60 m) in the region. Respiration and circulation-driven divergence contribute similar (60, 40\%, respectively) amounts to the integrated oxygen budget on the Washington coast while respiration dominates the Oregon coast. Divergence, or circulation, contributes to the oxygen dynamics on the shelf in two ways: first, through the generation of retention features, and second, by determining variability.},

  abstract = {Climate-related shifts in marine mammal range and distribution have been observed in some populations; however, the nature and magnitude of future responses are uncertain in novel environments projected under climate change. This poses a challenge for agencies charged with management and conservation of these species. Specialized diets, restricted ranges, or reliance on specific substrates or sites (e.g., for pupping) make many marine mammal populations particularly vulnerable to climate change. High-latitude, predominantly ice-obligate, species have experienced some of the largest changes in habitat and distribution and these are expected to continue. Efforts to predict and project marine mammal distributions to date have emphasized data-driven statistical habitat models. These have proven successful for short time-scale (e.g., seasonal) management activities, but confidence that such relationships will hold for multi-decade projections and novel environments is limited. Recent advances in mechanistic modeling of marine mammals (i.e., models that rely on robust physiological and ecological principles expected to hold under climate change) may address this limitation. The success of such approaches rests on continued advances in marine mammal ecology, behavior, and physiology together with improved regional climate projections. The broad scope of this challenge suggests initial priorities be placed on vulnerable species or populations (those already experiencing declines or projected to undergo ecological shifts resulting from climate changes that are consistent across climate projections) and species or populations for which ample data already exist (with the hope that these may inform climate change sensitivities in less well observed species or populations elsewhere). The sustained monitoring networks, novel observations, and modeling advances required to more confidently project marine mammal distributions in a changing climate will ultimately benefit management decisions across time-scales, further promoting the resilience of marine mammal populations.},

First, the robustness of fish assemblages derived from three clustering algorithms, Average, Complete, and Ward’s linkage, was examined. For statistical reliability, the use of a bootstrap resampling technique to generate the confidence values for the clusters is emphasized. Two cluster validity indices were used to measure the efficiency and the quality of the clusters. To examine the stability of the results, clustering was carried out across different sample sizes and levels of data smoothing. Second, cluster analysis was carried out using a different combination of data standardization and dissimilarity measure. Ward’s linkage gave the most robust fish assemblages for both modes of data analyses. Four fish assemblages were identified which could be characterized according to the depth and the geographic distribution. This algorithm was then used to generate a heatmap to determine the species – area relationships. Specific areas were characterized by the identified species groups.},

  abstract = {Globally, coastal nearshore regions are an intersecting point for human and biological productivity, often serving as hotspots for subsistence, commercial, and recreational fishing activities. Despite this, many nearshore areas remain poorly understood, monitored or managed. This case study examined the nearshore sector of Oregon’s groundfish trawl fishery, which exists in shallow estuarine and continental shelf habitats common along the West Coast of North America; areas that are important for early life history stages of many commercial and recreational fisheries. The West Coast groundfish fishery includes over 90 different species, 40 of which occur within Oregon’s nearshore (here defined as the portion of the shelf extending seaward to a water depth of 200~m). The very shallow portions of the Oregon Coast (the area of the shelf inshore of 55~m) have been subject to limited scientific survey monitoring, and much of the details of the ecology, health, and processes in these habitats remain poorly understood. The utilization of the nearshore region by the commercial groundfish trawl fleet is also minimally documented despite the fact that experiential knowledge (local ecological knowledge [LEK]; trawl logbooks, fish tickets, interviews) exists. This research explored the capacity of capturing LEK sources to inform and enhance understanding of the drivers of effort and the vitality of nearshore fishery resources. Our approach used statistical analysis and mapping of nearshore trawl effort from 1981 to 2017 and gathered semi-structured interviews of intergenerational fishermen to bolster data-poor areas. Insights provided by sampling strategies and historical to current knowledge of access to groundfish assemblages provide informed baselines for future management. Spatial mapping results revealed a decline in trawl effort on the Oregon continental shelf thought time.

  abstract = {The juvenile demersal fish assemblage along the Pacific Northwest coast has received little attention relative to adult life history stages since pioneering work in the 1970s. Increasing severity of hypoxia along the Oregon coast in recent years has prompted investigations into the response of biota in this region. We used summer data (2008e2013) from a beam trawl survey targeting juvenile demersal fishes in soft-bottom habitats along the Oregon coast to describe patterns of distribution and abundance at fixed sampling stations (from 30 m to 100 m depth). We relate the assemblage and abundance of the common species to environmental variables and analyze condition of recently settled fish ({$<$}50 mm SL). Most of the captured fishes were young-of-the-year flatfishes, dominated by Butter Sole (Isopsetta isolepis), English Sole (Parophrys vetulus), Speckled Sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus), and Pacific Sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus). Community analysis of the full dataset showed some variation in species richness among years and high evenness across all sampling sites and years. Depth was a structuring variable for the community, indicated by multivariate nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. Generalized additive models for common flatfish species abundances during the summer months indicated depth preferences, with Butter Sole, English Sole, and Speckled Sanddab at shallower locations and Pacific Sanddab occurring at deeper locations farther offshore. Additionally, while most common species were collected in high abundances in hypoxic conditions, dissolved oxygen was a significant factor in determining flatfish abundance. Condition factor was weakly negatively impacted by low dissolved oxygen for the species assessed, but the strength of the relationship varied by species. Increased sampling frequency and spatial coverage would improve our understanding of this community, especially in light of changing environmental drivers such as decreasing pH, warming water, and episodic periods of low dissolved oxygen coinciding with settlement for many species.},

  abstract = {Larval and age-0 sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria reside in neustonic waters of the North Pacific during spring and summer. We estimated the potential impacts of elevated surface temperatures on ecological processes of growth, conversion efficiency, and behavior in early juvenile sablefish. Growth experiments tested a wide range of temperatures from 6 to 24°C, with fish receiving ad libitum or low (3\% body weight d–1) rations. With unlimited food, growth increased rapidly as temperature increased to 14°C, then displayed a more gradual rise to 22°C. Growth rates at the warmer temperatures were among the highest recorded for teleosts, attaining a maximum of 3.3 mm d–1 in length and a specific growth in weight of 11.8\%. A similar response to temperature was observed at low rations, although at lower overall growth rates. At 24°C, there was a severe decline in growth for both ration levels, and few fish survived the 3 wk experiments. Gross growth efficiency, measured at temperatures of 6 to 22°C, displayed an interactive effect of temperature with ration level consistent with bioenergetic relationship. Conversion peaked at 16 to 20°C for fish receiving ad libitum rations, and at 10°C for fish on restricted rations. Conversion rates of sablefish were comparable to those calculated for a diverse array of fish species, suggesting that the rapid growth rates are driven by high consumption rather than unusually efficient energy transfer. Experiments analyzing sablefish behavior in thermally stratified water columns demonstrated increasing movement into colder water as ration level decreased, in agreement with an energy conserving strategy. Average monthly temperatures within the major nursery areas of neustonic juveniles (north of 40°N) did not exceed 19°C during the last 19 yr. These results suggest that juvenile sablefish are capable of tolerating and thriving at increased temperatures, with the critical caveat that sufficient food resources must be available. Thus, impacts on early life stages exerted by El Niño conditions, oceanographic regime shifts, or climate changes induced by current global warming scenarios are likely to be a consequence of indirect effects on circulation and productivity patterns rather than direct effects of warmer temperatures. However, because the upper thermal limit for growth nearly coincides with the upper limit for survival, exhibiting a sharp demarcation between favorable growth conditions and intolerable temperatures, juvenile sablefish at the southern limit of their distribution may suffer the direct effects of elevated temperature; recruitment of juveniles to southern populations may become more sporadic if the frequency of warming events increases with climate change.},

Nutrients are introduced into this circulation from two sources: (1) the flow along the 100-m isobath with intrusions of nutrient-rich water in Pribilof Canyon, and (2) the westward transport and vertical mixing of middle-shelf water, which contains nutrient-rich bottom water. Enhanced tidal mixing around the Pribilofs introduces this deeper, nutrient-rich water into the euphotic zone and thus supports prolonged production around the islands. Further, the middle-shelf water that is advected into the region causes the upper 50m of the water column around the islands to freshen throughout the summer. This enhances the frontal structure and strengthens the baroclinic flow along the 100-m isobath. The strengthening of the frontal structure can moderate ecosystem productivity by limiting the intrusion of slope water rich in nutrients and oceanic copepods.},

  abstract = {In spring and fall 2005, cross- and along-shelf transects were sampled to evaluate the influence of physical forcing, including sea ice, tides, and winds, on the lower trophic levels of the Bering Sea ecosystem. The hydrography, nutrients, chlorophyll, and zooplankton abundance and species composition were all affected by the presence or absence of sea ice on a north–south transect along the 70-m isobath. In May, shelf waters between ∼59°N and 62°N were cold and relatively fresh, and benthic invertebrate larvae and chaetognaths were a significant fraction of the zooplankton community, while to the south the water was warmer, saltier, and the zooplankton community was dominated by copepods. The position of the transition between ice-affected and ice-free portions of the shelf was consistent among temperature, salinity, nutrients, and oxygen. This transition in the hydrographic variables persisted through the summer, but it shifted ∼150km northward as the season progressed. While a transition also occurred in zooplankton species composition, it was farther north than the physical/chemical transition and did not persist through the summer. Mooring data demonstrated that the change in the position of the transition in physical and chemical properties was due to northward or eastward advection of water onto and across the shelf. From south to north along the 70-m isobath, tidal energy decreased, resulting in a less sharply stratified water column on the northern portion of the middle shelf, as opposed to a well-defined, two-layered system in the southern portion. This more gradual stratification in the north permitted a greater response to mixing from winds, which were homogeneous from north to south. Thus the physical and biological structure at any one location over the middle shelf is dynamic over the course of a year, and results from a combination of in situ processes and climate-mediated regional forcing which is dominated in most years by sea ice.},

  abstract = {The southeastern, middle shelf of the Bering Sea has exhibited extreme variability in sea ice extent, temperature, and the distribution and abundance of species at multiple trophic levels over the past four decades. From 1972–2000, there was high interannual variability of areal extent of sea ice during spring (March–April). In 2000, this shifted to a 5-year (2001–2005) period of low ice extent during spring, which transitioned to a 4-year (2007–2010) period of extensive sea ice. High (low) areal extent of sea ice in spring was associated with cold (warm) water column temperatures for the following 6–7 months. The ocean currents also differed between warm and cold years. During cold years, the monthly-mean currents over the shelf were largely westward, while in warm years the direction of currents was more variable, with northward flow during December–February and relatively weak flow during the remainder of the year. The types and abundance of zooplankton differed sharply between warm and cold years. This was especially true during the prolonged warm period (2001–2005) and cold period (2007–2010), and was less evident during the years of high interannual variability. During the warm period, there was a lack of large copepods and euphausiids over the shelf; however, their populations rebounded during cold period. Small crustacean zooplankton taxa did not appear to vary between and warm and cold years. For both walleye pollock and Pacific cod, year-class strength (recruitment) was low during the prolonged warm period, but improved during the following cold period. Year-class strength did not appear to vary as a function of warm and cold years during the period of high year-to-year variability. Also, recruitment of arrowtooth flounder (a predator of pollock and cod) did not appear influenced by the warm or cold years. Finally, the distribution and relative abundance of fin whales appeared to differ in warm and cold years, with fewer whales on the southeastern, middle shelf during warm years.},

  abstract = {Sufficient oceanographic measurements have been made in recent years to describe the latitudinal variation in the physics of the eastern Bering Sea shelf and the potential impact of climate change on the species assemblages in the two ecosystems (north and south). Many of the predicted ecosystem changes will result from alterations in the timing and extent of sea ice. It is predicted that the sea ice in the northern Bering Sea will be less common in May, but will continue to be extensive through April. In contrast, the southern shelf will have, on average, much less sea ice than currently observed, but with large interannual and multiyear variability until at least 2050. Thus, even under current climate warming scenarios, bottom temperatures on the northern shelf will remain cold. Based on biophysical measurements, the southern and northern ecosystems were divided by a North–South Transition at ∼60°N. The northern middle shelf was characterized by a freshwater lens at the surface, cold bottom temperatures, and a thicker pycnocline than found on the southern shelf. Subsurface phytoplankton blooms were common. In contrast, the southern shelf stratification was largely determined by temperature alone; the pycnocline was thin (often{$<$}3m) and subsurface blooms were uncommon. Biological responses to climate warming could include greater north–south differences in zooplankton community structure, the transport of large Outer Shelf Domain crustacean zooplankton to the middle shelf, and the disappearance of two principal prey taxa (Calanus spp. and Thysanoessa spp.) of planktivorous fish, seabirds and whales. The response of commercially and ecologically important fish species is predicted to vary. Some species of fish (e.g., juvenile sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka) may expand their summer range into the northern Bering Sea; some (e.g., pink salmon, O. gorbuscha) may increase in abundance while still other species (e.g., walleye pollock and arrowtooth flounder; Theragra chalcogramma and Atheresthes stomias, respectively) are unlikely to become common in the north. The projected warming of the southern shelf will limit the distribution of arctic species (e.g., snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio) to the northern shelf and will likely permit expansion of subarctic species into the southern Bering Sea. The distribution and abundance of baleen whales will respond to shifts in prey availability; for instance, if prey are advected northward from the southeastern Bering Sea, an extension of range and an increase in seasonally migratory baleen whale numbers is anticipated. Thus, alteration of this ecosystem in response to climate change is expected to result in something other than a simple northward shift in the distribution of all species.},

  abstract = {More than 20 years of data from moorings, satellite-tracked drifters and hydrographic surveys are integrated to provide a comprehensive view of currents and transport on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. The major sources of water onto the eastern Bering Sea shelf are North Pacific water flowing through Unimak Pass and Bering Slope water flowing onto the shelf usually via the canyons that intersect the shelf break. Absolute geostrophic transport through Unimak Pass varies from an average of 0.25 Â 106 m3 sÀ1 (Sv) in the warm months to 0.43 Sv in the cold months. Flow along the 50-m isobath is weak, with a transport of o0.1 Sv (calculated from current meters) in summer and fall. The transport along the 100-m isobath measured at two locations is more than twice that along 50-m isobaths; in the summer at the Pribilof Islands it was 0.2 Sv and during spring and summer at 60°N the northward geostrophic transport (referenced to the bottom) was 0.31 Sv. Northward transport along the 100-m and 50-m isobaths accounts for approximately half of the transport through Bering Strait. A typical transit time from Unimak Pass to Bering Strait is 413 months and from Amukta Pass to Bering Strait via the Bering Slope Current is 48 months. Consequently, the source of most of the heat transported into the Arctic through Bering Strait is a result of air–sea interactions local to the northern Bering Sea. Analysis of the currents and water properties on the southern shelf indicates that \$ 50\% of the shelf water is exchanged with slope water during October–January each year. This exchange elevates the October midshelf average nitrate level from 6 μM to 14–16 μM by the end of January.},

There was moderate coherence in exceptionally strong and weak year-classes and correlations across stocks. Based on evidence of synchrony from these analyses, we used Bayesian hierarchical models to relate recruitment to environmental covariates for groups of stocks that may be similarly influenced by environmental processes based on their life histories. There were consistent relationships among stocks to the covariates, especially within the Gulf of Alaska and California Current. The best Gulf of Alaska model included Northeast Pacific sea surface height as a predictor of recruitment, and was particularly strong for stocks dependent on cross-shelf transport during the larval phase for recruitment. In the California Current the best-fit model included San Francisco coastal sea level height as a predictor, with higher recruitment for many stocks corresponding to anomalously high sea level the year before spawning and low sea level the year of spawning. The best Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands model included several environmental variables as covariates and there was some consistent response across stocks to these variables. Future research may be able to utilize these across-stock environmental influences, in conjunction with an understanding of ecological processes important across early life history stages, to improve identification of environmental drivers of recruitment.},

However, data are often insufficient at region-wide scales to assess the effects of extraction in coral reef ecosystems of developing nations. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, I overcome this difficulty by using a publicly accessible, fisheries-independent database to provide a broad scale, comprehensive analysis of human impacts on predatory reef fish communities across the greater Caribbean region. Specifically, this study analyzed presence and diversity of predatory reef fishes over a gradient of human population density. Across the region, as human population density increases, presence of large-bodied fishes declines, and fish communities become dominated by a few smaller-bodied species. Conclusions/Significance Complete disappearance of several large-bodied fishes indicates ecological and local extinctions have occurred in some densely populated areas. These findings fill a fundamentally important gap in our knowledge of the ecosystem effects of artisanal fisheries in developing nations, and provide support for multiple approaches to data collection where they are commonly unavailable.},

Here we develop a Bayesian state-space approach to test for the prevalence of alternative forms of growth rate variability (e.g., annual, cohort-level, or in the first year recruited to the fishery) in size-at-age data. We apply this technique to 29 Pacific groundfish species across the California Current, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea – Aleutian Islands marine ecosystems. About 40\% of modeled stocks were estimated to exhibit temporal growth variation. In the majority of stocks, growth trends fluctuated annually across ages in a single year, suggesting that either there are shared environmental features that dictate growth across multiple ages or the presence of some systematic (within-year) observation errors. This method represents a novel way to use size-at-age data from fishery or other sources to test hypotheses about growth dynamics variability.},

  abstract = {Population genetic variability and phylogeographical structure of the Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus (Teleostei: Pleuronectidae), were examined along the continental slope of the northeastern Pacific Ocean using sequences of the left domain of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region. Six sites were sampled in three primary biogeographical provinces (based on surface water temperatures), ranging from the subarctic to the warm temperate zones. Many haplotypes were discerned, totalling 90 for 110 individuals. Neighbour joining and parsimony analyses of the entire data set showed that some groups of haplotypes of adult Dover sole were widely distributed, suggesting either panmixia or homoplasy and reversals. However, a substantial number of groups of related haplotypes were geographically circumscribed, and there were significant differences among sites in the distribution of restricted haplotypes (based on a reduced number of characters), supporting geographical structure. Geographical differentiation of populations appeared to be consistent with the member-vagrant hypothesis for retention of the pelagic larvae in currents and recruitment to adult habitats, reducing long-distance dispersal. Results of this study indicate phylogeographical structure among some populations, despite extended pelagic larval periods, and apparent environmental homogeneity in the adult habitats along the continental slope.},

  abstract = {Little is known regarding the importance of early-life transport and dispersion mechanisms in determining recruitment variability for Pacific ocean perch (POP) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). These mechanisms influence the degree of, and variability in, connectivity between offshore natal areas (parturition sites) and inshore demersal nursery habitats for young-of-the year juveniles, and may thus play an important role in the “gauntlet” that individuals must survive from parturition to recruitment. As a first attempt to assess interannual variability in connectivity between natal and nursery areas for POP in the GOA in a synthetic manner, we developed a coupled biophysical individual-based model (IBM) for POP early life history and dispersal with simple representations of active vertical movement, passive horizontal movement, growth, and settlement in appropriate nursery habitat to integrate known early-life traits with variability in environmental forcing. We used an oceanographic model for the GOA based on the Regional Ocean Modeling system (ROMS) to provide the underlying daily physical environment to force the IBM for 1996–2011 and simulated hundreds of thousands of individual POP from parturition along the shelf break to settlement in inshore demersal nursery habitats as young-of-the-year. We used the IBM results to assess spatial patterns of annual “maximum potential” connectivity between presumed natal and nursery areas at alongshore scales of \textasciitilde{} 150\,km, as well as the interannual variability in these patterns. Results showed that, even in the absence of mortality, most ({$>$} 70\%) individuals were unsuccessful in dispersing from presumed natal areas along the continental shelf break to inshore nursery areas. For those that were successful, connectivity was directed in a counterclockwise fashion (southeast to northwest) around the GOA following prevailing current patterns. Typical dispersion distances were on the order of 100's of km alongshore, much larger than those inferred from genetic sampling. Natal areas from which the highest fractions of successful individuals originated were in the southeast GOA, while the nursery areas most frequently reached by those successful individuals were in the central GOA. POP from natal areas in the western GOA were consistently exported from the system and likely contribute little to the GOA population, although they may contribute to populations in the Aleutian Islands and eastern Bering Sea. We also found that annual indices derived from the connectivity matrices were not very strongly related to any of a suite of basin- and regional-scale environmental indices, reflecting the overall complexity and scale of the pathways POP in the GOA may undertake during their early life stages and suggesting that multiple drivers operating at different spatial and temporal scales influence connectivity patterns. Finally, while our results indicate that interannual variability in physical transport may have a substantial impact on connectivity, we found little support for the hypothesis that this alone drives variability in POP recruitment.},

Previous research has shown large uncertainties in simulating future changes in this critical system. The simulated THC response to idealized freshwater perturbations and the associated climate changes have been intercompared as an activity of World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project/Paleo-Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP/PMIP) committees. This intercomparison among models ranging from the earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) to the fully coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) seeks to document and improve understanding of the causes of the wide variations in the modeled THC response. The robustness of particular simulation features has been evaluated across the model results. In response to 0.1-Sv (1 Sv ≡ 10\textsuperscript{6} m\textsuperscript{3} s\textsuperscript{−1}) freshwater input in the northern North Atlantic, the multimodel ensemble mean THC weakens by 30\% after 100 yr. All models simulate some weakening of the THC, but no model simulates a complete shutdown of the THC. The multimodel ensemble indicates that the surface air temperature could present a complex anomaly pattern with cooling south of Greenland and warming over the Barents and Nordic Seas. The Atlantic ITCZ tends to shift southward. In response to 1.0-Sv freshwater input, the THC switches off rapidly in all model simulations. A large cooling occurs over the North Atlantic. The annual mean Atlantic ITCZ moves into the Southern Hemisphere. Models disagree in terms of the reversibility of the THC after its shutdown. In general, the EMICs and AOGCMs obtain similar THC responses and climate changes with more pronounced and sharper patterns in the AOGCMs.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Climate models with biogeochemical components predict declines in oceanic dissolved oxygen with global warming. In coastal regimes oxygen deficits represent acute ecosystem perturbations. Here, we estimate dissolved oxygen differences across the global tropical and subtropical oceans within the oxygen minimum zone (200–700-dbar depth) between 1960–1974 (an early period with reliable data) and 1990–2008 (a recent period capturing ocean response to planetary warming). In most regions of the tropical Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans the oxygen content in the 200–700-dbar layer has declined. Furthermore, at 200dbar, the area with O2 {$<$}70μmolkg−1, where some large mobile macro-organisms are unable to abide, has increased by 4.5 millionkm2. The tropical low oxygen zones have expanded horizontally and vertically. Subsurface oxygen has decreased adjacent to most continental shelves. However, oxygen has increased in some regions in the subtropical gyres at the depths analyzed. According to literature discussed below, fishing pressure is strong in the open ocean, which may make it difficult to isolate the impact of declining oxygen on fisheries. At shallower depths we predict habitat compression will occur for hypoxia-intolerant taxa, with eventual loss of biodiversity. Should past trends in observed oxygen differences continue into the future, shifts in animal distributions and changes in ecosystem structure could accelerate.},

Longer records (9–34 years) of monthly ASL indicate that these two harmonics adequately represent the long-term monthly average seasonal cycle and that the current measurement period is long enough to estimate the seasonal cycles. We characterize the differences between fall/winter and spring/summer as follows: For fall/winter, monthly mean winds north of 35°N are northward for 3–6 months (longer in the north than in the south); south of 35°N, the mean winds are near zero or weakly southward; monthly mean alongshore currents are northward over midshelf and shelf break at all locations sampled at depths of 35 m and deeper and are associated with high coastal sea levels and relatively warm water temperatures. For spring/summer, monthly mean wind stresses are southward at all latitudes for 3–6 months (longer in the south than in the north), sea levels are low, and water temperatures are relatively cool; monthly mean currents at 35 m depth over the shelf are southward for 1–6 months (longer at the shelf break than over midshelf and longer in the north than in the south), while the deeper currents are less southward or northward. The magnitudes of the seasonal cycles of all variables are maximum between approximately 38°N and 43°N, generally decreasing slightly to the north and greatly to the south. At each location the seasonal cycle of the alongshore current from 35 m depth at midshelf leads the sea level slightly and both lead the wind stress and temperatures by 1–2 months. The seasonal cycles of all variables show a south-to-north progression (south leads north by 1–2 months). At 48°N, annual mean currents at 50 m depth over the shelf break oppose the annual mean wind (northward wind and southward current). Similarly, at 35°N, annual mean currents at 35 m depth over both midshelf and shelf break are opposed to the annual mean wind (southward wind and northward current). From 35°N to 43°N, both summer and winter regimes are dominated by strongly fluctuating currents.},

In spring and summer, an equatorward jet develops next to the coast, with an initial latitudinal structure that responds to the latitudinal distribution of equatorward alongshore winds. This jet moves offshore from spring to fall and develops meanders and closed eddies that contribute eddy kinetic energy and water mass properties to the nearby deep ocean. Higher EKE appears first in spring near the coast and moves offshore with the seasonal jet. Along altimeter tracks parallel to the coastline 200 and 400 km offshore, the greatest EKE is found in summer and fall, respectively, with wavelengths of approximately 300 km. These are the wavelengths of the largest meanders and the distance between the largest eddies visible in altimeter “snapshots” of the jet. At 600–800 km offshore, the wavelengths are generally smaller (100–150 km), similar to eddy sizes reported by others for the quiescent northeast Pacific. Some energy with longer wavelengths arrives at the track 600km offshore in winter and 800 km offshore in spring, which we interpret as the most offshore extension of the EKE generated by the jet and eddy system closer to the coast in the previous spring and summer. A sequence of snapshots from October 1992 to October 1993 shows details of the evolution of the jet and eddy system over one complete annual cycle.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen availability limits marine productivity across large ocean regions. Diazotrophs can supply new nitrogen to the marine environment via nitrogen (N2) fixation, relieving nitrogen limitation. The distributions of diazotrophs and N2 fixation have been hypothesized to be generally controlled by temperature, phosphorus, and iron availability in the global ocean. However, even in the North Atlantic where most research on diazotrophs and N2 fixation has taken place, environmental controls remain contentious. Here we measure diazotroph composition, abundance, and activity at high resolution using newly developed underway sampling and sensing techniques. We capture a diazotrophic community shift from Trichodesmium to UCYN-A between the oligotrophic, warm (25–29\,°C) Sargasso Sea and relatively nutrient-enriched, cold (13–24\,°C) subpolar and eastern American coastal waters. Meanwhile, N2 fixation rates measured in this study are among the highest ever recorded globally and show significant increase with phosphorus availability across the transition from the Gulf Stream into subpolar and coastal waters despite colder temperatures and higher nitrate concentrations. Transcriptional patterns in both Trichodesmium and UCYN-A indicate phosphorus stress in the subtropical gyre. Over this iron-replete transect spanning the western North Atlantic, our results suggest that temperature is the major factor controlling the diazotrophic community structure while phosphorous drives N2 fixation rates. Overall, the occurrence of record-high UCYN-A abundance and peak N2 fixation rates in the cold coastal region where nitrate concentrations are highest (\textasciitilde 200\,nM) challenges current paradigms on what drives the distribution of diazotrophs and N2 fixation.},

  abstract = {A new multivariate analysis technique, developed to relate community composition to known variation in the environment, is described. The technique is an extension of correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging), a popular ordination technique that extracts continuous axes of variation from species occurrence or abundance data. Such ordination axes are typically interpreted with the help of external knowledge and data on environmental variables; this two—step approach (ordination followed by environmental gradient identification) is termed indirect gradient analysis. In the new technique, called canonical correspondence analysis, ordination axes are chosen in the light of known environmental variables by imposing the extra restriction that the axes be linear combinations of environmental variables. In this way community variation can be directly related to environmental variation. The environmental variables may be quantitative or nominal. As many axes can be extracted as there are environmental variables. The method of detrending can be incorporated in the technique to remove arch effects. (Detrended) canonical correspondence analysis is an efficient ordination technique when species have bell—shaped response curves or surfaces with respect to environmental gradients, and is therefore more appropriate for analyzing data on community composition and environmental variables than canonical correlation analysis. The new technique leads to an ordination diagram in which points represent species and sites, and vectors represent environmental variables. Such a diagram shows the patterns of variation in community composition that can be explained best by the environmental variables and also visualizes approximately the 'centers' of the species distributions along each of the environmental variables. Such diagrams effectively summarized relationships between community and environment for data sets on hunting spiders, dyke vegetation, and algae along a pollution gradient.},

The method is designed to extract synthetic environmental gradients from ecological data-sets. The gradients are the basis for succinctly describing and visualizing the differential habitat preferences (niches) of taxavia an ordination diagram. Linear multivariate methods for relating two set of variables, such as two-block Partial Least Squares (PLS2), canonical correlation analysis and redundancy analysis, are less suited for this purpose because habitat preferences are often unimodal functions of habitat variables. After pointing out the key assumptions underlying CCA, the paper focuses on the interpretation of CCA ordination diagrams. Subsequently, some advanced uses, such as ranking environmental variables in importance and the statistical testing of effects are illustrated on a typical macroinvertebrate data-set. The paper closes with comparisons with correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis, PLS2 and co-inertia analysis. In an appendix a new method, named CCA-PLS, is proposed that combines the strong features of CCA and PLS2.},

  abstract = {Upwelling in eastern boundary current systems is a primary driver of ecosystem productivity. Typically, peak upwelling occurs during spring and summer, but winter upwelling may also be important to ecosystem functions. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that winter and spring/summer upwelling, operating through indirect trophic interactions, are important to a suite of top predators in the California Current. To test this hypothesis, we collated information on upwelling, chlorophyll-a concentrations, zooplankton and forage fish, and related these to predator responses including rockfish growth, salmon abundance, seabird productivity and phenology (timing of egg-laying), and whale abundance. Seabird diets served in part as food web indicators. We modeled pathways of response using path analysis and tested for significance of the dominant paths with multiple regression. We found support for the hypothesis that relationships between upwelling and top predator variables were mediated primarily by intermediate trophic levels. Both winter and summer upwelling were important in path models, as were intermediate lower and mid trophic level functional groups represented by chlorophyll-a, zooplankton, and forage fish. Significant pathways of response explained from 50\% to 80\% of the variation of seabird (Cassin’s auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and common murre (Uria aalge)), humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) dependent variables, whereas splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa) showed no significant response pathways. Upwelling and trophic responses for salmon were established for both the year of ocean entry and the year of return, with zooplankton important in the year of ocean entry and forage fish important in the year of return. This study provides one of the first comparative investigations between upwelling and predators, from fish to marine mammals and birds within a geographically restricted area, demonstrates often difficult to establish ‘‘bottomup’’ trophic interactions, and establishes the importance of seasonality of upwelling to various trophic connections and predator demographic traits. Understanding change in the seasonality of upwelling is therefore required to assess dynamics of commercially and recreationally important upper trophic level species in eastern boundary current ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Boundary currents influence near-shore ecosystems worldwide, and understanding how fish assemblages change spatially and temporally throughout these systems is important for establishing the scale at which ecosystem-based management (EBM) should be conducted. Because most research on boundary currents in general, and the California Current System (CCS) in particular, have been restricted to only small portions of the systems, it is largely unknown whether fish assemblages in boundary currents form one coherent ecosystem or if changes in assemblage structure are locally independent. We expand the geographic scope of previous analyses on ichthyoplankton assemblages within boundary currents by comparing dynamics in 2 widely separated regions of the CCS: Oregon (\textasciitilde 45° N) and southern California (\textasciitilde 34° N) in spring and summer from 2004 to 2011. Both region and season affected assemblage structure. Some taxa that were moderately common in California were consistently rare or absent in Oregon (and vice versa), and the presence of most decreased in summer in both regions. However, the assemblages were very similar in some years. Off Oregon, the assemblage most resembled California’s when the ocean temperature was relatively high and northern anchovy Engraulis mordax was abundant. Assemblage dynamics were well explained by environmental change in Oregon. By contrast, California’s assemblage and environmental variability correlated poorly. Population sizes of taxa common to both regions did not fluctuate coherently in Oregon and California. These findings are important for EBM because they indicate that it is not possible to extrapolate results from spatially restricted localities to understand assemblage dynamics throughout the entire CCS.},

  abstract = {Forage fishes are ecologically and economically important in marine ecosystems worldwide and thus are a focal topic for ecosystem-based fisheries management. In the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), the community dynamics of forage populations have been studied at regional spatial scales, but not across regions. To evaluate indicators of the forage community at the ecosystem-wide scale, we examine temporal variability of forage assemblages in Northern (Oregon/Washington), Central (California; Point Reyes to Monterey Bay) and Southern (southern California) regions of the CCLME from 1998 through 2016 which include years with unprecedented climate variability. Forage communities fluctuated greatly between years within each region owing to regionally low abundances of common taxa in at least some years (e.g., rockfishes Sebastes spp. in each region). Comparison of species assemblages among regions indicate that that temporal shifts in assemblage structure were largely synchronous throughout the CCLME. However, dynamics of most individual taxa were out of phase between regions, indicating that different taxa drove the variability in each region. Within regions, taxa with similar adult ecological niches tended to co-vary, suggesting synchronous responses to environmental forcing. Major changes in forage assemblage structure are descriptively linked to large oceanographic perturbations such as the transition from El Niño to La Niña conditions in 1998, anomalous upwelling in 2005, and the onset of a large marine heatwave in fall-winter 2013–2014. Changes in forage assemblage structure are reflected in prey switching in the diet of California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, in the Southern region. The multivariate forage indices that we develop can serve as effective indicators of regional forage community composition shifts in the CCLME and provide managers with context on spatio-temporal changes in the structure of forage fish communities important to top predators in this system.},

Spatial or temporal variation in condition can contribute to otherwise unexplained variation in the relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment. Individual condition is also included in age-structured population models, which use weight at age to convert population estimates between numbers and biomass. However, no study has analyzed spatial and temporal variation in condition for multiple marine species. Here I apply recent improvements in spatial modeling to analyze coastwide variation in condition for 28 groundfishes in the California Current. I show that, on average, 22\% of individual-level variation in condition can be explained via persistent (constant over time) and annually varying spatial differences in condition, and condition for many species varies 10 to 20\% spatially and among years. While population density, bottom temperature, and calendar date are parsimonious descriptors of condition in several species, the sign of these coefficients varies, and their magnitude is small relative to the magnitude of residual spatial and temporal variation. Additionally, annually varying spatial differences have nearly twice the magnitude of persistent spatial differences in condition. I therefore conclude that dynamic habitat conditions contribute a substantial portion of variation in individual condition for these groundfishes. Spatial and temporal variation in condition will be important for population models that convert between numbers, fishery catch, and population biomass, and may also clarify unexplained variability in productivity for marine fishes.},

  pages = {17},
  abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade‐offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio‐temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE‐in‐space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum‐likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio‐dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case‐study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC‐selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40\% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE‐in‐space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade‐offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast shortterm climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

  abstract = {Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs. To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977–2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast. In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator). We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

  abstract = {Heceta Bank is a major area for commercial fishing off Oregon and provides a wide range of structural habitats for demersal fishes, particularly rockfishes. In 2006, the bank was designated as an Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) Conservation Area closed to bottom trawling. A series of human-occupied (HOV) and remotely operated (ROV) submersible studies focusing on the fishes, invertebrates, and seafloor habitat of Heceta Bank began in 1987, and has largely continued until the present. Early studies focused on characterizing fishes and megafaunal invertebrates and describing the distributions of these assemblages in relation to habitat. As stocks of West Coast groundfish declined, research priorities shifted to a habitat-based strategy to develop methods for estimating the abundance of fishes in untrawlable habitats, identifying fish-habitat associations and potential essential fish habitat, and expanding the inference of the data to larger spatial scales in order to provide reliable data for fishery management. This shift in priorities coincided with the application of new technologies that provided a detailed multibeam sonar map of the bank, more accurate geographic positioning of the in situ platform (e.g., submersible and support ship), higher resolution video, greater capability to collect samples, and the development of more sophisticated statistical methods. Future research will likely continue to be driven by emerging fishery issues and developing advanced technologies. Research will need to focus on new priorities as they emerge, such as the development of ecosystem-based management, the effects of climate change, and offshore mining and energy development. One of the challenges now is to efficiently relate small-scale observations and assessments of animal-habitat associations collected by direct observations from submersibles and other in situ platforms to the larger geographic scales upon which fisheries operate.},

Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40°N–50°N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

Here, we used vector autoregressive spatio-temporal models (VAST) to delineate spatial and temporal patterns in juvenile density for 13 commercially important species of groundfishes off the US west coast. In particular, we identified hotspots with high juvenile density. Three qualitative patterns of distribution and abundance emerged. First, Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, Pacific grenadier Coryphaenoides acrolepis, shortspine thornyhead Sebastolobus alascanus, and splitnose rockfish Sebastes diploproa had distinct, spatially-limited hotspots that were spatially consistent through time. Next, Pacific hake Merluccius productus and darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri had distinct, spatially limited hotspots, but the location of these hotspots varied through time. Finally, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, English sole Parophrys vetulus, sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, Pacific grenadier Coryphaenoides acrolepis, lingcod Ophiodon elongatus, longspine thornyhead Sebastolobus altivelis, petrale sole Eopsetta jordani, and Pacific sanddab Citharichthys sordidus had large hotspots that spanned a broad latitudinal range. These habitats represent potential, if not likely, nursery areas, the location of which will inform spatial management.},

  abstract = {We analyzed data from the National Marine Fisheries Service continental slope trawl surveys (1999–2002) to examine patterns in eastern Pacific groundfish assemblage structure in relation to longitude, latitude, depth, temperature, and interannual variation. The slope surveys spanned approximately 32–488N and 200–1,200-m depths. We focused on the 26 most abundant species, which made up more than 95\% of the catch in terms of biomass. Assemblage structure was strongly correlated with depth and latitude. For the most part, changes in assemblage structure appeared to be fairly continuous, although there were more-abrupt changes at approximately 500–600 m and in the vicinity of Point Conception and Cape Mendocino, California, and Cape Blanco, Oregon. There was also an interaction between depth and latitude; more northerly sites had deeper scores on the canonical axes than did more southerly sites of comparable depth. Shallower sites also showed more variation in assemblage structure with latitude than did deeper sites. We were able to identify five assemblages on the continental slope. Pacific grenadiers Coryphaenoides acrolepis, giant grenadiers Albatrossia pectoralis, deepsea soles Embassichthys bathybius, longspine thornyheads Sebastolobus altivelis, California slickheads Alepocephalus tenebrosus, and roughtail skate Bathyraja trachura formed a deepwater assemblage with a broad latitudinal range. Southern species that inhabited very shallow waters included splitnose rockfish Sebastes diploproa, spotted ratfish Hydrolagus colliei, English soles Parophrys vetulus, stripetail rockfish Sebastes saxicola, chilipeppers Sebastes goodei, and shortbelly rockfish Sebastes jordani. Shallow-water, midlatitude species included spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias, longnose skate Raja rhina, Pacific hakes Merluccius productus, rex soles Glyptocephalus zachirus, bigfin eelpout Lycodes cortezianus, and sandpaper skate Bathyraja interrupta. Darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, and Pacific Ocean perch Sebastes alutus were identified as a shallow, northerly assemblage. The final group—sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, brown cat sharks Apristurus brunneus, aurora rockfish Sebastes aurora, Dover soles Microstomus pacificus, and shortspine thornyheads Sebastolobus alascanus—occurred at different depths over a range of latitudes and might be best described as a shallow–middepth and midlatitude–southern grouping.},

  abstract = {Small demersal fishes were collected along the central Oregon coast using a shrimp trawl with small-mesh liner. The trawl was deployed bimonthly in 1989 along 3 transects and along a single transect in March 1989 to 1994. Forty species, 19 of which are not commercially important and rarely reported in other studies, occurred in {$>$} 5\% of the samples. Species assemblages were structured primarily by depth, with mid-shelf stations dominated by flatfishes; on the outer shelf and slope, gadids, scorpaenids, osmerids, and zoarcids were also important. Additionally, 4 out of 5 identified station groups were more closely associated with a single season. Seasonal assemblage structure included a broad range of species whose distributions shifted inshore in summer. This phenomenon, previously described for only a few species off Oregon, further accentuated the correlation of assemblages with depth. Seasonal shifts in distributions appeared to be a function of juvenile settlement and ontogenetic changes in nursery habitat and of seasonal inshore-offshore movements of individuals of many sizes, which indicated that sediment type was not the only feature important in habitat selection. March assemblages were weakly structured by interannual differences, in spite of environmental conditions ranging from the cold La Niña of 1989 to the warm El Niño of 1992. The largest annual differences were among short-lived species and likely reflected differences in recruitment. This study targeted smaller fish than are collected in most bottom trawl surveys and illustrates the importance of seasonal changes in habitat for smaller fish and the value of understanding all life stages in a demersal fish community.},

Blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou were consumed more often during the summer months, whereas mackerel Scomber scombrus and Trisopterus spp. (poor cod T. minutus, Norway pout T. esmarkii, and bib T. luscus) were found more often in predator stomachs during the winter half-year. On a spatial scale, blue whiting was consumed over the shelf edge, in accordance with their higher densities in the environment, while mackerel, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus and Trisopterus spp. were eaten more often on the continental shelf, again in agreement with their depth-related density-distribution patterns. The spatial distribution of whiting closely matched that of a key prey, Trisopterus spp. This might indicate an ‘aggregative response’ by the predator. The results of this study suggest spatial and seasonal prey-switching behaviour by cod, hake and whiting. Overall, the Celtic Sea fish community is characterised by opportunistic predators and general independence between predator and prey distributions. Interspecific predator interactions are reduced by size-, space- and time-dependent feeding behaviours.},

Over this 12-year period, 1,862 coded-wire-tagged juvenile Chinook salmon were recovered along the coasts of Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska from March to November. Except for those from the Columbia River, most juvenile Chinook salmon remained within 100–200 km of their natal rivers until their second year at sea, irrespective of their freshwater history and adult run timing. Northward migration of most coastal stocks was initiated during their second or possibly third year at sea, whereas the Strait of Georgia and Puget Sound stocks primarily migrated onto the continental shelf after their first year at sea. In contrast, Columbia River Chinook salmon generally undertook a rapid northward migration that varied among life histories and stocks. Columbia River spring Chinook salmon were recovered as far north as Prince William Sound, Alaska, during their first summer at sea, whereas very few Columbia River fall Chinook salmon were recovered north of Vancouver Island. In addition to northern migrants, a fraction of the Columbia River spring and fall Chinook salmon actively migrated south of the Columbia River. The stock-specific initial ocean migration routes described in this study will aid in the identification of the appropriate spatial and temporal scales for assessing the processes regulating Chinook salmon recruitment in the marine environment.},

Selecting one method over another usually involves some subjectivity, yet can be consequential to the provision of advice. Extensive case-specific testing is not always feasible. We evaluated the forecast skill in 3-, 5- and 10-year forecasts of 16 recruitment forecasting methods under various circumstances to provide a broad evaluation and general guidelines on the reliability of forecasts. We used 31 operating models based on existing stock assessment models applied to a diversity of stocks with empirical data, which we show to be generally representative of assessed stocks worldwide. Although no single best-performing method could be identified, we found that time-series methods were most likely to perform poorly. Both forecast skill across all methods and forecast sensitivity to the selected method were linked to the properties of the stock or assessment: age at maturity and recruitment autocorrelation in 3-year forecasts and previous long-term recruitment variability in 10-year forecasts. In some situations, all forecasting methods resulted in systematic over- or underestimation of spawning stock biomass. The simulation approach employed here to assess forecast performance, rooted directly in the predictions of existing stock assessment models, can be a complementary tool to existing simulation approaches which generate alternative sets of population dynamics or observations and we discussed the advantages and limitations.},

To understand the influence of ocean circulation on groundfish recruitment in the eastern Bering Sea, we examined transport along and across the Bering Slope derived from 23 years (1982–2004) of simulations from a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) ocean circulation model. We expected that changes in the strength and position of the Bering Slope Current (BSC) would affect recruitment in selected species (Pacific cod, walleye pollock, Greenland halibut, Pacific halibut, and arrowtooth flounder), and that circulation features along and across the shelf edge would be strongly influenced by atmospheric forcing. Variability in along-shelf transport at three transects along the path of the BSC, cross-shelf transport across the 100 and 200 m isobaths, and transport through Unimak Pass were examined. Strong seasonal and interannual variations in flow were observed, with transport typically highest during fall and winter months, coinciding with timing of spawning activity in the five species. Significant correlations were found between transport, BSC position, and groundfish recruitment. Pacific cod, in particular, benefitted from decreased along-shelf and on-shelf flow, while Pacific halibut recruitment increased in relation to increased on-shelf transport through southern canyons. The results of this study improve our understanding of variability in circulation and associated effects on groundfish recruitment in the eastern Bering Sea.},

  abstract = {Flatfishes of Monterey Bay, central California, undergo species replacements with increasing depth along a transect from 100 m on the continental shelf down to a depth of 1400 m on the continental slope. The Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus, differs from the other local flatfish species by undergoing an extensive ontogenetic vertical migration, occupying all depth zones at different life stages, and having its maximum spawning biomass in the oxygen minimum zone between 600 and 1000 m. Size-activity relationships and depth-activity relationships for the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and for two enzymes associated with aerobic metabolism, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase (CS), were examined in white-muscle tissue of shallow-living, deep-living and ontogenetically-migrating species. Scaling coefficients (b) for weight-specific enzyme activity (log activity)=a+b (log wet weight), varied in sign as well as magnitude for fishes living at different depths. In the shallow-living California halibut Paralichthys californicus, LDH scaled positively (0.39) and CS scaled negatively (-0.15) with size, a pattern observed previously for most shallow-water fish species. The permanently deep-living species, the deepsea sole Embassichthys bathybius, differed in that both LDH and CS scaled strongly negative (-2.0 and-1.5, respectively). For the ontogenetically migrating Dover sole Microstomus pacificus, there was a shelf-slope transition. For the shelf specimens (≤200 m), LDH scaled positive (0.11) and CS negative (-0.29) and for the slope specimens (≥400 m), LDH scaled negative (-0.65) and CS strongly negative (-0.63). Rex sole, Glyptocephalus zachirus, showed a similar shelf-slope transition. Intraspecific depth-enzyme activity differences were not incremental, but changed abruptly between the continental shelf stations (100 to 200 m) and the continental slope (400 to 1400 m). Based on comparisons with laboratory-maintained individuals, the decline in the metabolic capacity of the white muscle of Dover sole is a phenotypic response to the low food and oxygen conditions of the continental slope. Contrary to expectation, anaerobic capacity (LDH activity) decreased in response to low oxygen conditions, suggesting that in a permanently hypoxic environment such as the oxygen minimum zone the metabolic strategy may be to not incur an oxygen debt that would be difficult to pay back.},

  abstract = {Previous metabolic studies of scorpaenid fishes have measured inter- and intra-specific differences in physiological and biochemical capacities in fishes living at different depths. Small sample sizes and undocumented provenance of the samples studied have not allowed a full examination of the environmental basis for metabolic adaptation. The objective of this study was to determine the bathymetric demography of 22 scorpaenid fishes of the genera Sebastes and Sebastolobus, and to examine inter- and intra-specific changes in metabolic capacity in 4 of them (Sebastes goodei, Sebastes diploproa, Sebastolobus alascanus and Sebastolobus altivelis) representative of different environmental conditions. We attempted to collect samples that spanned the full depth and size ranges of each species. We examined changes in metabolic capacity as it was affected by size, depth of occurrence, and the existence of an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) centered at 800 m. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured as an indicator of glycolytic capacity. Citrate synthase (CS), a Krebs cycle enzyme, was measured as an indicator of aerobic capacity. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH), an enzyme which helps maintain redox balance between the mitochondrion and cytosol, was also used as an indicator of aerobic capacity. When normalized to a common size, S. goodei, S. diploproa, S. alascanus and S. altivelis displayed an inter-specific pattern of declining metabolic activity with depth of occurrence. Intra-specific size scaling of glycolytic capacity (LDH) was positive in the shallow-living S. goodei. However, no scaling occurred in S. diploproa and S. alascanus, and negative scaling of glycolytic activity occurred in the deep-living S. altivelis. MDH did not scale in S. goodei and S. diploproa but was negative in the 2 deeper-living Sebastolobus species. CS activity scaled negatively in S. goodei, S. alascanus, and S. altivelis, but the deep-water specialist, S. altivelis, had the steepest slope. S. altivelis was the only species where similar-sized individuals could be compared over a wide depth range. There was no elevation of LDH, or increase in anaerobic poise, in response to the hypoxia of the OMZ. Rather, all 3 enzyme activities were highest at 600 m and generally declined with increasing depth. Contrary to the existing paradigm, S. alascanus and S. altivelis were not found to be shallow- and deep-living congeners. Rather, S. altivelis is a permanent resident of deep water, while S. alascanus settles in shallow water then migrates to deep water with the onset of sexual maturity. When living in deep water, the supposed shallow water species, S. alascanus, maintains higher activities of all enzymes and grows an order of magnitude larger ({$>$}5000 vs {$<$}500 g). In deep-water slope habitats expected patterns of allometric scaling of white muscle enzyme activities appear to be altered by the limitations of food and oxygen availability, a pattern previously observed in flatfishes.},

  abstract = {During a 7-year study of the food-chain dynamics of the outer and middle shelves of the southeastern Bering Sea, numerical models were developed to test ecological hypotheses posed at the event, seasonal, and annual scales of habitat variability. Interannual variations in year class strength of Alaska pollock between warm and cold years are attributed to an order of magnitude decline in prey availability during larval drift in cold years. In cold years delayed increases in seasonal abundance of copepod nauplii, the prey of these larval fish, are attributed to low temperature effects on crustacean metabolism rather than to changes in food availability (phytoplankton). Sinking diatoms, uneaten by the zooplankton in the water column during warm or cold years, are resuspended by wind events and advected seaward every 3 to 5 days during the spring. The ungrazed phytoplankton from the outer shelf are moved offshore and deposited on the adjacent slope. Because of the unusual width of the Bering shelf (∼500km) and a seasonal decline in the number of upwelling, favorable wind events, diatoms of the middle shelf are not exported. They are consumed instead by the benthos, with 10-fold larger infaunal biomass found here than on the outer shelf. An annual carbon budget for the middle shelf suggests consumption of all the primary production in this regime, compared to an apparent export of 48\% of the outer shelf primary production to the continental slope.},

The geographical distribution of and ecological controls on nitrogen fixation are difficult to constrain with limited in situ measurements. Here we present convergent estimates of nitrogen fixation from an inverse biogeochemical and a prognostic ocean model. Our results demonstrate strong spatial variability in the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio of exported organic matter that greatly increases the global nitrogen-fixation rate (because phytoplankton manage with less phosphorus when it is in short supply). We find that the input~of~newly fixed~nitrogen from microbial fixation and external inputs (atmospheric deposition and river fluxes) accounts for up to 50 per cent of carbon export in subtropical gyres. We also find that nitrogen fixation and denitrification are spatially decoupled but that nevertheless nitrogen sources and sinks appear to be balanced over the past few decades. Moreover, we propose a role for top-down zooplankton grazing control in shaping the global patterns of nitrogen fixation. Our findings suggest that biological~carbon export in the ocean~is higher than expected and that stabilizing nitrogen-cycle feedbacks are weaker than previously thought.},

The proposed method works well in both predicting the response and estimating the coefficient surface, based on a simulation study. Finally, we have applied this methodology to real-world mobile computer sales data, and demonstrated its superiority by comparing with elastic net- and kernel regression-based varying-coefficient model.

  abstract = {The relationship between gas exchange and wind speed is used extensively for estimating bulk fluxes of atmospheric gases across the air-sea interface. Here, I provide an update on the frequently used method of Wanninkhof (1992). The update of the methodology reflects advances that have occurred over the past two decades in quantifying the input parameters. The general principle of obtaining a relationship constrained by the globally integrated bomb-14CO2 flux into the ocean remains unchanged. The improved relationship is created using revised global ocean 14C inventories and improved wind speed products. Empirical relationships of the Schmidt number, which are necessary to determine the fluxes, are extended to 40°C to facilitate their use in the models. The focus is on the gas exchange of carbon dioxide, but the suggested functionality can be extended to other gases at intermediate winds (≈4−15 m s−1). The updated relationship, expressed as k = 0.251 {$<$}U2{$>$} (Sc/660)−0.5 where k is the gas transfer velocity, {$<$}U2{$>$} is the average squared wind speed, and Sc is the Schmidt number, has a 20\% uncertainty. The relationship is in close agreement with recent parameterizations based on results from gas exchange process studies over the ocean.},

However, practical management constraints, institutional structures and communication issues have also contributed to the lack of integration.

  abstract = {The Pacific groundfish fishery management plan was first approved in 1982, formalizing what would become one of the most economically important fisheries on the West Coast of the U.S. In 2015, the fishery as a whole generated approximately \$170 million in income and supported almost 3,000 jobs. Since its inception, the fishery management plan has been amended more than 30 times, transforming a fishery characterized by high discards and overcapacity into one managed under a catch share program that was designed to reduce fishing capacity, help rebuild overfished stocks, and provide for a viable, profitable, and efficient fishery. This paper reviews historical management measures as well as changes in both the fishery resource and the operational characteristics of fishery participants, such as rebuilding stocks, reduced bycatch, seasonality of catch, diversification, and revenues. Observed changes vary across sector and target species, but economic data highlight, among other findings, that consolidation has occurred across shorebased sectors, the seasonality of landings has shifted for whiting sectors, and fleet-wide days at sea have decreased for the non-whiting groundfish fleet. Though these changes cannot be directly attributed to any single management measure, the transition to catch shares coincided with increasing economic benefits to many harvesters and communities in a fishery that was declared an economic disaster less than two decades ago. This review can serve as a resource for managers, stakeholders, and researchers involved in developing, implementing, and analyzing regulations in complex multispecies fisheries.},

  abstract = {Bottom trawling and use of other mobile fishing gear have effects on the seabed that resemble forest clearcutting, a terrestrial disturbance recognized as a major threat to biological diversity and economic sustainability. Structures in marine benthic communities are generally much smaller than those in forests, but structural complexity is no less important to their biodiversity. Use of mobile fishing gear crushes, buries, and exposes marine animals and structures on and in the substratum, sharply reducing structural diversity. Its severity is roughly comparable to other natural and anthropogenic marine disturbances. It also alters biogeochemical cycles, perhaps even globally. Recovery after disturbance is often slow because recruitment is patchy and growth to maturity takes years, decades, or more for some structure-forming species. Trawling and dredging are especially problematic where the return interval—the time from one dredging or trawling event to the next—is shorter than the time it takes for the ecosystem to recover; extensive areas can be trawled 100–700\% per year or more. The effects of mobile fishing gear on biodiversity are most severe where natural disturbance is least prevalent, particularly on the outer continental shelf and slope, where storm-wave damage is negligible and biological processes, including growth, tend to be slow. Recent advances in fishing technology (e.g., rockhopper gear, global positioning systems, fish finders) have all but eliminated what were de facto refuges from trawling. The frequency of trawling (in percentage of the continental shelf trawled per year) is orders of magnitude higher than other severe seabed disturbances, annually covering an area equivalent to perhaps half of the world’s continental shelf, or 150 times the land area that is clearcut yearly. Mobile fishing gear can have large and long-lasting effects on benthic communities, including young stages of commercially important fishes, although some species benefit when structural complexity is reduced. These findings are crucial for implementation of “Essential Fish Habitat” provisions of the U.S. Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act which aim to protect nursery and feeding habitat for commercial fishes. Using a precautionary approach to management, modifying fishing methods, and creating refuges free of mobile fishing gear are ways to reduce effects on biological diversity and commercial fish habitat.},

The surface ocean ecosystem response has been previously characterized using limited in situ and autonomous field measurements and numerical modeling, but basin-scale satellite remote sensing has been limited to a simple description of chlorophyll variability. Here, we show that the ecosystem response is a complex combination of phytoplankton biomass and physiology that can be described with satellite ocean color diagnostics such as the chlorophyll-to-carbon biomass ratio (Chl:Cphyto) and chlorophyll fluorescence yield. Together, these quantities outline a more complete picture of ecological responses spanning unique signals of iron stress (and relief from), photoacclimation, changes in phytoplankton growth rate, increases in biomass, and timescales of decay for these processes.},

  abstract = {This study provides a retrospective analysis of the relationship between physical oceanography, biology and recruitment of three Eastern Bering Sea flatfish stocks: flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) during the period 1978–2005. Stock assessment model estimates of recruitment and spawning stock size indicate that temporal patterns in productivity are consistent with decadal scale (or shorter) patterns in climate variability, which may influence marine survival during the early life history phases. Density-dependence (through spawning stock size) was statistically significant in a Ricker stock-recruit model of flatfish recruitment that included environmental terms. Wind-driven advection of northern rock sole and flathead sole larvae to favorable nursery grounds was found to coincide with years of above-average recruitment. Ocean forcing of Bristol Bay surface waters during springtime was mostly on-shelf (eastward) during the 1980s and again in the early 2000s, but was off-shelf (westerly) during the 1990s, corresponding with periods of good and poor recruitment, respectively. Finally, the Arctic Oscillation was found to be an important indicator of arrowtooth flounder productivity. Model results were applied to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) future springtime wind scenarios to predict the future impact of climate on northern rock sole productivity and indicated that a moderate future increase in recruitment might be expected because the climate trends favor on-shelf transport but that density-dependence will dampen this effect such that northern rock sole abundance will not be substantially affected by climate change.},

  abstract = {Joint species distribution models (JSDMs) simultaneously model the distributions of multiple species, while accounting for residual co-occurrence patterns. Despite increasing adoption of JSDMs in the literature, the question of how to define and evaluate JSDM predictions has only begun to be explored. We define four different JSDM prediction types that correspond to different aspects of species distribution and community assemblage processes. Marginal predictions are environment-only predictions akin to predictions from single-species models; joint predictions simultaneously predict entire community assemblages; and conditional marginal and conditional joint predictions are made at the species or assemblage level, conditional on the known occurrence state of one or more species at a site. We define five different classes of metrics that can be used to evaluate these types of predictions: threshold-dependent, threshold-independent, community dissimilarity, species richness and likelihood metrics. We illustrate different prediction types and evaluation metrics using a case study in which we fit a JSDM to a frog occurrence dataset collected in Melbourne, Australia. Joint species distribution models present opportunities to investigate the facets of species distribution and community assemblage processes that are not possible to explore with single-species models. We show that there are a variety of different metrics available to evaluate JSDM predictions, and that choice of prediction type and evaluation metric should closely match the questions being investigated.},

To handle diffuse population limits, indicators are designed not to depend on arbitrary delineation of the domain. They characterize the location (centre of gravity and spatial patches), occupation of space (inertia, isotropy, positive area, spreading area and equivalent area) and microstructure. Collocation between different populations is summarized by a global index of collocation. These spatial indicators have the potential to be used in a monitoring system to detect changes in spatial distribution. They could be helpful for relating the spatial distribution properties of fish stocks to their dynamics, their habitats, or to climate change.},

These declines combined with current overfishing, habitat degradation, and pollution paint a grim picture for the future of marine fisheries and ecosystems. However, current models forecasting such declines do not account for the effects of ocean fronts as biogeochemical hotspots. Here we apply a fundamental technique from fluid dynamics to an ecosystem model to show how fronts increase total ecosystem biomass, explain fishery production, cause regime shifts, and contribute significantly to global biogeochemical budgets by channeling nutrients through alternate trophic pathways. We then illustrate how ocean fronts affect fishery abundance and yield, using long-term records of anchovy–sardine regimes and salmon abundances in the California Current. These results elucidate the fundamental importance of biophysical coupling as a driver of bottom–up vs. top–down regulation and high productivity in marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Human-dominated marine ecosystems are experiencing accelerating loss of populations and species, with largely unknown consequences. We analyzed local experiments, long-term regional time series, and global fisheries data to test how biodiversity loss affects marine ecosystem services across temporal and spatial scales. Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21\%, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations. Yet available data suggest that at this point, these trends are still reversible. An extensive meta-analysis of data from 32 studies shows that loss of marine biodiversity is increasingly impairing the health of the oceans, yet these trends may still be reversible.

A conspicuous pattern is alternating warm and cool periods of several years' duration. These variations in sea ice cover are reflected in the character of a subsurface cold pool, formed as stratification isolates the deeper cold waters from surface exchanges. The cold pool is better developed and more extensive in summers that follow deep southward penetration of winter sea ice. Interannual and decadal-scale variations in the distributions of some fish stocks reflect those of ice and thermal conditions. In particular, the distribution of walleye pollock, Theragra chalcogramma, varies significantly with multiannual cool and warm years while Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, is only present within the cold pool. The relation among climate variations, sea ice cover, subsurface thermal conditions, and fish distribution provides information on how climate affects marine ecosystems and may also have practical application in predicting fish distributions.},
